Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War  I  when  the  US  army  experimented  with  unmanned  aerial  torpedoes.  Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations.  Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various drone functionalities in order to critically assess drone technology and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of unmanned aerial vehicles. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors from three different SMU schools (LKCSB, SIS and SOL)  plus exposure to drone entrepreneurs  and  first-hand,  team-based  experiences  in  piloting  mini drones  within  the SMU campus.","info_instructors":["EUGENE TAN KHENG BOON"," KAN SIEW NING"," THOMAS MENKHOFF"]}},"IS613":{"name":"Cybersecurity Technology and Applications","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - IT in Business","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Information Systems","info_academic_organization":"School of Info Systems MITB","info_description":"This course provides an introduction to cybersecurity.

Students have to perform due diligence and research the industry/job functions they are interested in and what the careers, occupation or their dream job entail and relate it back to their self-assessment and career plan. They need to conduct sufficient research into the companies of choice and how they could “navigate their way” into these companies and job functions. They also need to consider closing skills gaps, if any, and the career path and advancement. \n\nThis workshop introduces to students effective job search strategies, informational interviews, how to get insider’s information on industry and job function requirements.\n\nThe outcome is for students to make a more informed decision on their choice career and options available.\n\n\nFTW202 Resume and Cover Letter Writing \nThis workshop will equip students with the skills to write an effective Cover Letter and resume that will help them secure an internship – this is just the basic workshop as most 2nd years will not have sufficient internship or work experience to help them enhance their employability. Students will be exposed to different formats and the effective uses under various circumstances.

The emphasis should be for students to build a believable and consistent long-lasting personal brand with focus on core values for the workplace and in society, not just being well-groomed. \n\nNetworking skills are critical for students to succeed. To be effective networkers, they need to understand the acceptable decorum and etiquette for establishing business relationships and friendships; and the “how-tos” of maintaining contacts and building long-term relationships at work and play. \n\nThrough this workshop students can be more aware of developing and maintaining a consistent personal brand both in the online and offline world and become more comfortable in having conversations with other peers and professionals in both a social and work-based setting.\n\nFTW205 Interviewing Skills\nInterviews can be at times daunting and can be very stressful especially if the candidate walks into an interview without adequate preparation.

Goods and services cannot move on their own from supply houses to demand locales, conferring transportation a central role in their distributions. Transportation contributes and increases the values in the chain by performing the \"moving\" functions in the physical distribution of products. In broader terms, transportation is often referred to as the lifelines of a nation and its economy because they are the preconditions for progress and development. Globalization complements trade and further magnifies the importance of efficient and effective transportation.  This course explores the business issues in the design and operations of transportation systems and underlines their strategic importance to firms and the economy. It discusses the core concepts and terminologies of road, air, rail and sea transportation, as well as, the role of international sourcing and logistics in contemporary supply chain management. When introducing the operational aspects of international logistics, the course also highlights the essentialities of international payment, documentation and insurances.","info_instructors":["JOYCE LOW MEI WAN","Staff"]}},"OPIM321":{"name":"Supply Chain Management","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"Matching supply with demand is a primary challenge for a firm: excess supply is too costly, inadequate supply irritates customers. Matching supply to demand is easiest when a firm has a flexible supply process, but flexibility is generally expensive. In this course we will learn (1) how to assess the appropriate level of supply flexibility for a given industry and (2) explore strategies for economically increasing a firm’s supply flexibility. Lastly we will study coordination and incentives across multiple firms in a supply chain. While tactical models and decisions are part of this course, the emphasis is on the qualitative insights needed by general managers or management consultants.

As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster’s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners’ innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill.\n\nThis course should be of particular interest to people aspiring for a career in designing and managing for innovation, either directly (e.g., V.P. of R&D, R&D Manager) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course will also be useful to SME proprietors and entrepreneurs who intend to serve new markets, or use new technologies, or participants who wish to strategically reposition their offerings in an existing market. The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between innovation and business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources.","info_instructors":["SHANTANU BHATTACHARYA"]}},"MUSC001":{"name":"Music: East and West","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Social Sciences","info_academic_organization":"School of Social Sciences","info_description":"The course seeks to enable students to understand the fundamental principles that govern all music through an active and critical approach.

Economic expansion or recession will change all business forecasts; market structure will affect profitability; fluctuating exchange rates will have an impact on costs, sales, risk perceptions and debt levels; and the state of the national budget or interest-rate decisions can color a company ́s future. In particular, a global recession like the one suffered recently can transform consumption behavior and business strategies. Managerial Economics provides students with a framework to understand the main economic variables and dynamics that affect business activity. Understanding the microeconomy is the first stepping-stone toward achieving a full grasp of the economic world that surrounds us. Most of the world ́s countries rely on free markets to make most of their economic decisions, and those markets automatically answer the key economic questions (What will we produce? How will we produce it? At what price? Who will get it?) through the operation of supply and demand. The course will review the basic concepts of supply, demand, market failures and externalities to provide a broad perspective on how free markets work. It will then move on to elasticity and market structures and their impact on profitability. The objective is to give students a firm understanding of how supply and demand at the micro-level determine the basic parameters of doing business. Yet markets are not perfect. In our times, a period of deregulation and strong faith in markets to solve economic problems has been followed by the deepest economic crisis since the early 20th century, with devastating effects on output, income and employment nearly everywhere. The experience has brought back to the fore the key questions of how economic decisions should be made, and how much governments should intervene when market failures exist, especially in light of pressing problems such as environmental deterioration which the market appears poorly equipped to solve. The second part of the course will focus on the macroeconomy and the policies that governments follow, and how the interaction between free economic forces and policy affect the business cycle and company prospects. It will begin by analyzing the key macroeconomic indicators --GDP, inflation and unemployment and the business cycle--, and evaluate how changes in these variables affect businesses. It will then outline the dynamics of the macroeconomy, the operation of fiscal and monetary policies and how and why policy decisions are made, to give students the tools to anticipate key policy decisions and understand their impact on the macroeconomy. Finally, the course moves from the micro and national levels to the global level, for a look at international trade, exchange rates and the balance of payments. It will detail the forces of trade, the determinants of exchange rates, and the important concepts underlying the balance of payments; and how all of those elements of the international economy affect business. In the process, we will encounter an explanation for the Great Contraction that occurred beginning in 2008, and will be able to understand how the crisis has and will change our economic lives. A special focus will be given to the Asian markets to see their dynamics.","info_instructors":["Staff"]}},"ECON235":{"name":"International Macroeconomics","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Economics","info_academic_organization":"School of Economics","info_description":"This course will cover basic concepts, tools and facts needed to understand the functioning of the global economy and international financial markets.

Students will be unsurprised that there is some overlap with issues encountered in domestic trade. The reasons why the course is of interest are two-fold. The first relates to the discussion of why the element of internationality adds complexity to commercial transactions – these stem largely from the fact that distance engenders a lack of trust and an amplification of the risk of something going wrong. The second is as to how legal mechanisms are ingeniously constructed in an attempt to overcome these two problems, amongst others. To facilitate discussion of these two issues, the paradigmatic sale and carriage of goods is used. Also touched upon are international contract law instruments (e.g. the CISG), documents of carriage like bills of lading, international trade customs (e.g. incoterms like the ubiquitous FOB and CIF contracts), financing arrangements (e.g. UCP 600), transport (e.g. the Hague-Visby rules) and insurance, and international commercial dispute resolution.

The ‘data economy’ renders digitized information - promulgating at ever increasing speed – a valuable asset through the use of data analytics. It has also led to a fundamental shift in power and markets. The emergence of disruptive technological and business innovations is one prominent example of such a change. New economies are formed, such as from the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the development of ‘cognitive services’, the digitization of goods and the provision of storage/sharing and management services. Governments, including the Singapore public sector, are also aware of the importance of data to governance and to the future of the economy and are driving innovations and technology usage within that sector as well as in society generally through the Smart Nation initiative and Digital Economy drive. Substantial research and development are also encouraged in this field.\n\nThese fundamental shifts also lead to many problems and challenges related to different types of data and data sets. For Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and the data economy generally, cybersecurity is a major concern. In relation to personal data and digital communications, there are various threats to different forms of privacy. Other current issues surrounding data are the ‘fake news’ phenomenon and the persistent threats to intellectual property. On the flipside, these developments have also led to new industries (and careers) such as in the areas of cybersecurity and data protection.\n\nThe objective of this course is to prepare students who are interested in data protection law and may have an interest in making a career in this nascent industry that is set to grow. Students will first be introduced to the data economy as a concept and to the real changes to the market and to society as well as the various forms and categorisations of data and the legal aspects to these data sets. The second part of the course will then focus on privacy law and its relationship with data protection (DP) law. In this context, comparative study will be made of privacy and DP regimes of significance (e.g. OECD, EU, APEC, etc.). Third, students will then focus their study on the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (and other relevant laws) – in particular, the data protection and do not call provisions - by looking at its history, objective, scope/application and possible future developments e.g. Data Protection Ecosystem and PDPA Act Review. Comparative study of similar concepts and processes in other jurisdictions will also be assessed in the course of the study of the Singapore PDPA. The fundamental concepts and workings of the PDPA will be examined in depth. In the fourth part of the course, practitioners from the PDPC and the private sector will provide their perspectives on this process and a holistic and practical viewpoint to the study. \n\nAfter completing this course, students will be able to use what they have learnt to obtain professional certification such as from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) and PDPC with a view to practice in this area as a privacy counsel, privacy professional, manager and/or technologist. This will prepare students for a career in this growing field, or at least provide them with the skills and knowledge when dealing with such issues as a TMT lawyer, legal counsel or even as a general legal practitioner that will possibly encounter these issues at work.","info_instructors":["KAM WAI WARREN BARTHOLOMEW CHIK"," LANX GOH","Staff"]}},"LAW406":{"name":"International Commercial Arbitration","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Law","info_academic_organization":"School of Law","info_description":"International commercial arbitration has held itself out to be a fast, convenient and confidential means of binding dispute resolution.

(2) What can a Singapore court be asked to do to prevent a foreign court from adjudicating? (3) When will a Singapore court apply something other than the domestic law of Singapore to determine the claim? And (4) what effect will a foreign judgment have in Singapore?

Second, in analysing capitalism, we adopt a long historical view that traces the emergence of its fundamental logics and global expanse back to the eighteenth century.

To understand how people make choices or decisions, we need to understand the thinking, reasoning and judgment processes involved. In addition, decision and choice situations often involve making tradeoffs (e.g. price versus quality) or evaluating multiple different options and alternatives. With limited human cognitive capacity and the multiple task demands involved in choice and decision making, it appears that reasoning or decision-making processes are challenging. This course will help you understand these complexities and processes. It will cover topics such as judgments of risk and uncertainty, affect and decision making, self-control, heuristics and biases. In addition, we will connect decision-making theories to other areas of application, such as negotiation, consumer behaviour, and team processes.","info_instructors":["TSAI MING-HONG","Staff"]}},"WRIT001":{"name":"Programme in Writing and Reasoning","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Ctr for English Communication","info_academic_organization":"Ctr for English Communication","info_description":"The Programme in Writing and Reasoning (PWR) equips students with key communication strategies to write cogently in academic, business and professional settings.
