Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War  I  when  the  US  army  experimented  with  unmanned  aerial  torpedoes.  Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations.  Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various drone functionalities in order to critically assess drone technology and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of unmanned aerial vehicles. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors from three different SMU schools (LKCSB, SIS and SOL)  plus exposure to drone entrepreneurs  and  first-hand,  team-based  experiences  in  piloting  mini drones  within  the SMU campus.","info_instructors":["EUGENE TAN KHENG BOON"," KAN SIEW NING"," THOMAS MENKHOFF"]}},"IS613":{"name":"Cybersecurity Technology and Applications","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - IT in Business","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Information Systems","info_academic_organization":"School of Info Systems MITB","info_description":"This course provides an introduction to cybersecurity.

Students enrolled in the FTW200 will undertake the FTW200 series under the same instructor for five recurring weeks from Week 3 to Week 7 of the school term. Each component is a three-hour session.\n\nFTW201 Job Search Strategies\nJob search strategies will help students who have a general idea of their preferences or bias for certain type of job functions to explore deeper into the career of choice. Students have to perform due diligence and research the industry/job functions they are interested in and what the careers, occupation or their dream job entail and relate it back to their self-assessment and career plan. They need to conduct sufficient research into the companies of choice and how they could “navigate their way” into these companies and job functions. They also need to consider closing skills gaps, if any, and the career path and advancement. \n\nThis workshop introduces to students effective job search strategies, informational interviews, how to get insider’s information on industry and job function requirements.\n\nThe outcome is for students to make a more informed decision on their choice career and options available.\n\n\nFTW202 Resume and Cover Letter Writing \nThis workshop will equip students with the skills to write an effective Cover Letter and resume that will help them secure an internship – this is just the basic workshop as most 2nd years will not have sufficient internship or work experience to help them enhance their employability. Students will be exposed to different formats and the effective uses under various circumstances. They will be taught how to create a CV and the sections which are normally included in a CV and the contents to be featured under each section. Advanced CV writing will be taught as an elective in the 3rd or 4th year for those who want help and guidance to strengthen their CVs and start their job applications. \n\nThis workshop will focus on how to build a good resume as well as how to craft a resume and cover letter befitting to the industry and internship/job they are applying for. \n\n\nFTW203 Social Etiquette and Groom for Success\nThis workshop will deliver to students the knowledge of good personal hygiene and effective grooming and how to conduct themselves in professional and social setting. This workshop should spark their interest to discover themselves and how best to project a confident and professional image as coverage is wide and may not offer sufficient depth. Students are encouraged to do more research on their own or attend workshops which will give them the depth they desire. \n\n\nFTW204 Personal Branding and Networking Skills\nSMU has built a credible brand among the employers however, its brand attributes must also be reflected in its students. There are certain attributes that have attracted employers to SMU students, such as being articulate, innovative, intellectual curiosity, courage to challenge the status quo, adventuresome, skilful and resourceful. The emphasis should be for students to build a believable and consistent long-lasting personal brand with focus on core values for the workplace and in society, not just being well-groomed. \n\nNetworking skills are critical for students to succeed. To be effective networkers, they need to understand the acceptable decorum and etiquette for establishing business relationships and friendships; and the “how-tos” of maintaining contacts and building long-term relationships at work and play. \n\nThrough this workshop students can be more aware of developing and maintaining a consistent personal brand both in the online and offline world and become more comfortable in having conversations with other peers and professionals in both a social and work-based setting.\n\nFTW205 Interviewing Skills\nInterviews can be at times daunting and can be very stressful especially if the candidate walks into an interview without adequate preparation. Students can use the interview session to their advantage to impress the interviewers and present themselves as good potential hires.

Inventors have been observed to be playfully conceiving new product designs and experiences in history as well as in technological innovation. The course investigates this link between play and invention through a broad treatment of the phenomena that examines historical and modern cultural domains (the historical treatment will comprise half or more of the examples). Play was borne out of not only of human desires for leisure and frivolity, but also necessity and cultural purposes, e.g. learning and community bonding respectively. We will broadly construe the forms of play relevant to invention to include not only the creation of playful artifacts, but also the playing around (or playfulness) observed in inventors’ actions, and the passions of inventors.\n\nThe course articulates the relationship between play and invention through both, study, and actual practice using creativity tools and design techniques. We illustrate the link between play and invention through studies of inventors’ life experiences, where their “playing” with concepts, technology and even cultural interpretations helped them to foster new ideas and inventions. Such play involves the creative combining of different concepts, which involves crossing boundaries between knowledge domains, and experimentation. In practicing the ‘play-to-invent’ relationship, we will cover creativity tools for ‘ideating’ concepts from diverse sources of knowledge, and design prototyping methods to flesh out and trial the ideas and concepts. In-class exercises and projects will serve as contexts for teaching and demonstrating these techniques. Note that while these techniques originate from the creative thinking and design fields, our goals are not to exercise sheer creativity for creativity’s sake, or to apply the full cycle of user-centered design thinking. \n\nTo reflect on how play is relevant to successful invention, we will cover a range of social scientific concepts for understanding play in theoretical terms, as well as how play has become relevant to culture. We will also contextualize our learning by covering a range of specific creative domains, including the visual arts, fashion, shopping, narrative, visual arts, food, and digital media. Key principles are highlighted in each domain and its designed forms to help understand how invention occurs within that domain, e.g. the nature of narrative in film, and the role of blends in cuisine. We also show how blends have occurred over historical time, such as when inventors made connections across domains as distantly-related as fashion, early London and Paris shopping galleries, American suburban malls and Disney theme parks; and those of early mechanical toys, computers, and musical instruments. Play facilitates creative blending by cross-fertilizing ideas from different domains, allowing ‘forms’ to transcend boundaries, and ultimately, to radically reshape leisure and culture. \n\nComparisons will be made between historical and modern ‘forms’, and examples will come from across continents, largely from European and American history. A significant part of the course will be a project to design innovative experiences or other ‘forms’ using the creative and design tools, and by incorporating the students’ understanding of the aesthetics and effects of play.","info_instructors":["TED FEICHIN TSCHANG"]}},"COMM102":{"name":"Foundations in Strategic Communication","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"COMM102 is the core course of the communication management major.

For this reason, pitching can be both incredibly terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. \n\nUnderstanding the fundamentals as well as the mechanics of pitching will take you far towards successfully pitching your ideas. And there’s nothing like good, old-fashioned practice with plenty of feedback from peers and experts to help you hone your pitching skills. In this course, we will explore the fundamentals and mechanics of effective pitches and put into practice everything we are learning week by week towards becoming successful pitchers. \n\nWhile many people think of pitching as only useful for those who need to raise money (for example, a start-up pitch), pitching is actually an essential skill for reaching agreement on almost any subject. Agreement can yield many outcomes: management buy-in for developing a product or service, closing a sale, securing a partnership, recruiting an employee, securing an investment, and even securing employment for yourself. \n\nNancy Duarte, a communication specialist, put it this way: “Companies are started, products are launched, climate systems are saved – possibly based on the quality of presentations. Likewise, ideas, endeavours, and even careers can be cut short due to ineffective communication.” In this course, you will be given a good foundation for successful pitching so that no worthy idea or endeavour of yours will fall short simply because it wasn’t effectively conveyed.","info_instructors":["TOM ESTAD"]}},"COMM246":{"name":"Crisis Management and Communication","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"Organizations are, literally, experiencing and battling crises of some form or other every day. This can be internal crises like organizational miscommunication, personality clashes; to external crises, for instance, arising from policy mismanagement to terrorism. Due to the vulnerability of the organization to both internal and external uncertainties, no organization is immune from crises. \n\nWhile organizations recognize the probability of the occurrence of crises, studies have shown that many do not have any preparation or plan to deal with them. Some do not find it necessary to take preventive measures; others simply do not know where to begin, and what to do. Indeed, strategic crisis management is a multifaceted discipline that involves components from issues management, crisis communication and management, conflict recovery and resolution. \n\nThis course aims to equip students with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, how to communicate during crises, and how to recover and learn from crises. The emphasis, thus, is on the preventive, rather than reactive, aspects of crisis management.\n\nScholars agree that crisis management is a dynamic, ongoing process, through a life cycle. Students will be taken through each step of the life cycle of a crisis, with the aim of helping them learn what they need to do at each phase. While many scholars have posited different frameworks, for this course, Wilcox, Cameron and Reber’s (2015) proactive-strategic-reactive-recovery framework is adopted because of its emphasis on the preventive aspects. \n\nIt is a useful course for those who wish to be equipped with knowledge for their work in public relations, consultancy, management, law, strategic communication, and public administration; or for those who wish to embark on research in these areas.","info_instructors":["YEO SU LIN"]}},"COMM332":{"name":"Campaigning and Communication Planning","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"This course helps students fulfil a key employment requirement of the communication industry: the ability to strategically and at high speed develop communication campaigns that support the competitiveness, the reputation, the market access and the licence to operate of their organization.

Economic expansion or recession will change all business forecasts; market structure will affect profitability; fluctuating exchange rates will have an impact on costs, sales, risk perceptions and debt levels; and the state of the national budget or interest-rate decisions can color a company ́s future. In particular, a global recession like the one suffered recently can transform consumption behavior and business strategies. Managerial Economics provides students with a framework to understand the main economic variables and dynamics that affect business activity. Understanding the microeconomy is the first stepping-stone toward achieving a full grasp of the economic world that surrounds us. Most of the world ́s countries rely on free markets to make most of their economic decisions, and those markets automatically answer the key economic questions (What will we produce? How will we produce it? At what price? Who will get it?) through the operation of supply and demand. The course will review the basic concepts of supply, demand, market failures and externalities to provide a broad perspective on how free markets work. It will then move on to elasticity and market structures and their impact on profitability. The objective is to give students a firm understanding of how supply and demand at the micro-level determine the basic parameters of doing business. Yet markets are not perfect. In our times, a period of deregulation and strong faith in markets to solve economic problems has been followed by the deepest economic crisis since the early 20th century, with devastating effects on output, income and employment nearly everywhere. The experience has brought back to the fore the key questions of how economic decisions should be made, and how much governments should intervene when market failures exist, especially in light of pressing problems such as environmental deterioration which the market appears poorly equipped to solve. The second part of the course will focus on the macroeconomy and the policies that governments follow, and how the interaction between free economic forces and policy affect the business cycle and company prospects. It will begin by analyzing the key macroeconomic indicators --GDP, inflation and unemployment and the business cycle--, and evaluate how changes in these variables affect businesses. It will then outline the dynamics of the macroeconomy, the operation of fiscal and monetary policies and how and why policy decisions are made, to give students the tools to anticipate key policy decisions and understand their impact on the macroeconomy. Finally, the course moves from the micro and national levels to the global level, for a look at international trade, exchange rates and the balance of payments. It will detail the forces of trade, the determinants of exchange rates, and the important concepts underlying the balance of payments; and how all of those elements of the international economy affect business. In the process, we will encounter an explanation for the Great Contraction that occurred beginning in 2008, and will be able to understand how the crisis has and will change our economic lives.

The term ‘back office’ is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today’s volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise. \n\nWith complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into ‘intelligent accounting functions’. \n\nIntelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities.\n\nThis accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects.","info_instructors":["PAN SHAN CHI"," GARY"," VENKY SHANKARARAMAN"]}}}}
