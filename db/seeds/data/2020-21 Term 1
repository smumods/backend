Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War  I  when  the  US  army  experimented  with  unmanned  aerial  torpedoes.  Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations.  Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various drone functionalities in order to critically assess drone technology and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of unmanned aerial vehicles. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors from three different SMU schools (LKCSB, SIS and SOL)  plus exposure to drone entrepreneurs  and  first-hand,  team-based  experiences  in  piloting  mini drones  within  the SMU campus.","info_instructors":["EUGENE TAN KHENG BOON"," KAN SIEW NING"," THOMAS MENKHOFF"]}},"IS613":{"name":"Cybersecurity Technology and Applications","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - IT in Business","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Information Systems","info_academic_organization":"School of Info Systems MITB","info_description":"This course provides an introduction to cybersecurity.

Students enrolled in the FTW200 will undertake the FTW200 series under the same instructor for five recurring weeks from Week 3 to Week 7 of the school term. Each component is a three-hour session.\n\nFTW201 Job Search Strategies\nJob search strategies will help students who have a general idea of their preferences or bias for certain type of job functions to explore deeper into the career of choice. Students have to perform due diligence and research the industry/job functions they are interested in and what the careers, occupation or their dream job entail and relate it back to their self-assessment and career plan. They need to conduct sufficient research into the companies of choice and how they could “navigate their way” into these companies and job functions. They also need to consider closing skills gaps, if any, and the career path and advancement. \n\nThis workshop introduces to students effective job search strategies, informational interviews, how to get insider’s information on industry and job function requirements.\n\nThe outcome is for students to make a more informed decision on their choice career and options available.\n\n\nFTW202 Resume and Cover Letter Writing \nThis workshop will equip students with the skills to write an effective Cover Letter and resume that will help them secure an internship – this is just the basic workshop as most 2nd years will not have sufficient internship or work experience to help them enhance their employability. Students will be exposed to different formats and the effective uses under various circumstances. They will be taught how to create a CV and the sections which are normally included in a CV and the contents to be featured under each section. Advanced CV writing will be taught as an elective in the 3rd or 4th year for those who want help and guidance to strengthen their CVs and start their job applications. \n\nThis workshop will focus on how to build a good resume as well as how to craft a resume and cover letter befitting to the industry and internship/job they are applying for. \n\n\nFTW203 Social Etiquette and Groom for Success\nThis workshop will deliver to students the knowledge of good personal hygiene and effective grooming and how to conduct themselves in professional and social setting. This workshop should spark their interest to discover themselves and how best to project a confident and professional image as coverage is wide and may not offer sufficient depth. Students are encouraged to do more research on their own or attend workshops which will give them the depth they desire. \n\n\nFTW204 Personal Branding and Networking Skills\nSMU has built a credible brand among the employers however, its brand attributes must also be reflected in its students. There are certain attributes that have attracted employers to SMU students, such as being articulate, innovative, intellectual curiosity, courage to challenge the status quo, adventuresome, skilful and resourceful. The emphasis should be for students to build a believable and consistent long-lasting personal brand with focus on core values for the workplace and in society, not just being well-groomed. \n\nNetworking skills are critical for students to succeed. To be effective networkers, they need to understand the acceptable decorum and etiquette for establishing business relationships and friendships; and the “how-tos” of maintaining contacts and building long-term relationships at work and play. \n\nThrough this workshop students can be more aware of developing and maintaining a consistent personal brand both in the online and offline world and become more comfortable in having conversations with other peers and professionals in both a social and work-based setting.\n\nFTW205 Interviewing Skills\nInterviews can be at times daunting and can be very stressful especially if the candidate walks into an interview without adequate preparation. Students can use the interview session to their advantage to impress the interviewers and present themselves as good potential hires.

Inventors have been observed to be playfully conceiving new product designs and experiences in history as well as in technological innovation. The course investigates this link between play and invention through a broad treatment of the phenomena that examines historical and modern cultural domains (the historical treatment will comprise half or more of the examples). Play was borne out of not only of human desires for leisure and frivolity, but also necessity and cultural purposes, e.g. learning and community bonding respectively. We will broadly construe the forms of play relevant to invention to include not only the creation of playful artifacts, but also the playing around (or playfulness) observed in inventors’ actions, and the passions of inventors.\n\nThe course articulates the relationship between play and invention through both, study, and actual practice using creativity tools and design techniques. We illustrate the link between play and invention through studies of inventors’ life experiences, where their “playing” with concepts, technology and even cultural interpretations helped them to foster new ideas and inventions. Such play involves the creative combining of different concepts, which involves crossing boundaries between knowledge domains, and experimentation. In practicing the ‘play-to-invent’ relationship, we will cover creativity tools for ‘ideating’ concepts from diverse sources of knowledge, and design prototyping methods to flesh out and trial the ideas and concepts. In-class exercises and projects will serve as contexts for teaching and demonstrating these techniques. Note that while these techniques originate from the creative thinking and design fields, our goals are not to exercise sheer creativity for creativity’s sake, or to apply the full cycle of user-centered design thinking. \n\nTo reflect on how play is relevant to successful invention, we will cover a range of social scientific concepts for understanding play in theoretical terms, as well as how play has become relevant to culture. We will also contextualize our learning by covering a range of specific creative domains, including the visual arts, fashion, shopping, narrative, visual arts, food, and digital media. Key principles are highlighted in each domain and its designed forms to help understand how invention occurs within that domain, e.g. the nature of narrative in film, and the role of blends in cuisine. We also show how blends have occurred over historical time, such as when inventors made connections across domains as distantly-related as fashion, early London and Paris shopping galleries, American suburban malls and Disney theme parks; and those of early mechanical toys, computers, and musical instruments. Play facilitates creative blending by cross-fertilizing ideas from different domains, allowing ‘forms’ to transcend boundaries, and ultimately, to radically reshape leisure and culture. \n\nComparisons will be made between historical and modern ‘forms’, and examples will come from across continents, largely from European and American history. A significant part of the course will be a project to design innovative experiences or other ‘forms’ using the creative and design tools, and by incorporating the students’ understanding of the aesthetics and effects of play.","info_instructors":["TED FEICHIN TSCHANG"]}},"COMM102":{"name":"Foundations in Strategic Communication","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"COMM102 is the core course of the communication management major.

For this reason, pitching can be both incredibly terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. \n\nUnderstanding the fundamentals as well as the mechanics of pitching will take you far towards successfully pitching your ideas. And there’s nothing like good, old-fashioned practice with plenty of feedback from peers and experts to help you hone your pitching skills. In this course, we will explore the fundamentals and mechanics of effective pitches and put into practice everything we are learning week by week towards becoming successful pitchers. \n\nWhile many people think of pitching as only useful for those who need to raise money (for example, a start-up pitch), pitching is actually an essential skill for reaching agreement on almost any subject. Agreement can yield many outcomes: management buy-in for developing a product or service, closing a sale, securing a partnership, recruiting an employee, securing an investment, and even securing employment for yourself. \n\nNancy Duarte, a communication specialist, put it this way: “Companies are started, products are launched, climate systems are saved – possibly based on the quality of presentations. Likewise, ideas, endeavours, and even careers can be cut short due to ineffective communication.” In this course, you will be given a good foundation for successful pitching so that no worthy idea or endeavour of yours will fall short simply because it wasn’t effectively conveyed.","info_instructors":["TOM ESTAD"]}},"COMM246":{"name":"Crisis Management and Communication","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"Organizations are, literally, experiencing and battling crises of some form or other every day. This can be internal crises like organizational miscommunication, personality clashes; to external crises, for instance, arising from policy mismanagement to terrorism. Due to the vulnerability of the organization to both internal and external uncertainties, no organization is immune from crises. \n\nWhile organizations recognize the probability of the occurrence of crises, studies have shown that many do not have any preparation or plan to deal with them. Some do not find it necessary to take preventive measures; others simply do not know where to begin, and what to do. Indeed, strategic crisis management is a multifaceted discipline that involves components from issues management, crisis communication and management, conflict recovery and resolution. \n\nThis course aims to equip students with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, how to communicate during crises, and how to recover and learn from crises. The emphasis, thus, is on the preventive, rather than reactive, aspects of crisis management.\n\nScholars agree that crisis management is a dynamic, ongoing process, through a life cycle. Students will be taken through each step of the life cycle of a crisis, with the aim of helping them learn what they need to do at each phase. While many scholars have posited different frameworks, for this course, Wilcox, Cameron and Reber’s (2015) proactive-strategic-reactive-recovery framework is adopted because of its emphasis on the preventive aspects. \n\nIt is a useful course for those who wish to be equipped with knowledge for their work in public relations, consultancy, management, law, strategic communication, and public administration; or for those who wish to embark on research in these areas.","info_instructors":["YEO SU LIN"]}},"COMM332":{"name":"Campaigning and Communication Planning","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"This course helps students fulfil a key employment requirement of the communication industry: the ability to strategically and at high speed develop communication campaigns that support the competitiveness, the reputation, the market access and the licence to operate of their organization.

Economic expansion or recession will change all business forecasts; market structure will affect profitability; fluctuating exchange rates will have an impact on costs, sales, risk perceptions and debt levels; and the state of the national budget or interest-rate decisions can color a company ́s future. In particular, a global recession like the one suffered recently can transform consumption behavior and business strategies. Managerial Economics provides students with a framework to understand the main economic variables and dynamics that affect business activity. Understanding the microeconomy is the first stepping-stone toward achieving a full grasp of the economic world that surrounds us. Most of the world ́s countries rely on free markets to make most of their economic decisions, and those markets automatically answer the key economic questions (What will we produce? How will we produce it? At what price? Who will get it?) through the operation of supply and demand. The course will review the basic concepts of supply, demand, market failures and externalities to provide a broad perspective on how free markets work. It will then move on to elasticity and market structures and their impact on profitability. The objective is to give students a firm understanding of how supply and demand at the micro-level determine the basic parameters of doing business. Yet markets are not perfect. In our times, a period of deregulation and strong faith in markets to solve economic problems has been followed by the deepest economic crisis since the early 20th century, with devastating effects on output, income and employment nearly everywhere. The experience has brought back to the fore the key questions of how economic decisions should be made, and how much governments should intervene when market failures exist, especially in light of pressing problems such as environmental deterioration which the market appears poorly equipped to solve. The second part of the course will focus on the macroeconomy and the policies that governments follow, and how the interaction between free economic forces and policy affect the business cycle and company prospects. It will begin by analyzing the key macroeconomic indicators --GDP, inflation and unemployment and the business cycle--, and evaluate how changes in these variables affect businesses. It will then outline the dynamics of the macroeconomy, the operation of fiscal and monetary policies and how and why policy decisions are made, to give students the tools to anticipate key policy decisions and understand their impact on the macroeconomy. Finally, the course moves from the micro and national levels to the global level, for a look at international trade, exchange rates and the balance of payments. It will detail the forces of trade, the determinants of exchange rates, and the important concepts underlying the balance of payments; and how all of those elements of the international economy affect business. In the process, we will encounter an explanation for the Great Contraction that occurred beginning in 2008, and will be able to understand how the crisis has and will change our economic lives.

The term ‘back office’ is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today’s volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise. \n\nWith complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into ‘intelligent accounting functions’. \n\nIntelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities.\n\nThis accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects.","info_instructors":["BENJAMIN LEE"," PRASART JONGJAROENKAMOL"]}},"FNCE101":{"name":"Finance","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"The course helps students understand the various financial activities undertaken by a firm to create value for its shareholders.

With complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into ‘intelligent accounting functions’. Intelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth.","info_instructors":["BENJAMIN LEE"," PAN SHAN CHI"," GARY"]}},"ACCT714":{"name":"Global Financial Markets and Institutions","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - DBA (A&F)","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Accountancy","info_academic_organization":"SOA GPBF","info_description":"The course focuses on how finance industry creates social value, and covers three topics, namely, whether the markets would make mistakes, how to use financial instruments to invest in changing markets, and how to use financial tools to solve problems for companies.

The term ‘sustainable innovation’ refers to the creation of new market space, products and services or processes driven by social, environmental or sustainability concerns. Just like general innovation, sustainable innovation goes way beyond incremental improvements of products, services or processes. The challenge is to proactively embrace risk management and sustainability considerations (environmental, social, financial) aimed at aligning (novel) business strategies with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to create and capture new value. If managed well by results-oriented, socially aware sustainability leaders, sustainable innovation results not only in greater effectiveness at (intra)organisational levels but also helps to create a cleaner, healthier, fairer (and hopefully more stable) world as envisaged by the circular economy. The urgent need for sustainability has never been greater as evidenced by rapid population growth, pollution, (toxic) waste, plastic accumulating in our oceans, limited natural resources, climate change etc. This course will introduce students to the managerial discipline of innovation management with particular reference to examples of ‘good’ / ‘best’ sustainable innovation practices adopted by both local and international organisations such as City Development Limited (CDL), Banyan Tree, Sustainability Center Freiburg (launched in 2015 by the University of Freiburg in cooperation with five Fraunhofer research institutes), Henkel BeautyCare (whose Social Plastic Ecosystem in partnership with the Plastic Bank social enterprise is aimed at stopping ocean plastic and simultaneously providing opportunities for people in poverty), Procter & Gamble’s Tide Eco-Box (which contains less packaging, 60% less plastic and 30% less water than the current Tide press-tap) and many more.","info_instructors":["KAN SIEW NING"," THOMAS MENKHOFF"]}},"MGMT711":{"name":"Innovation Development","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - D.

Students will also be exposed to the design studies tradition. \n\nPart 2: The second part of this course provides an overview of the innovation development process and the decisions that are made in the innovation development process. These decisions include:\n• the product definition (conceptualization and specifications to be included in the \n  product), the sharpness/fuzziness of the definition, the timing of the definition.\n• the design and formation of innovation teams, building trust between the different \n  partners, and the role of diversity, and\n• the management of risk in new product development, and the study of risk \n  management practices.","info_instructors":["SHANTANU BHATTACHARYA"," TED FEICHIN TSCHANG"]}},"MGMT736":{"name":"Conducting Research using Asian Data","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - DBA","info_units":0.25,"info_grading_basis":"Pass/Fail","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"LKCSB GPBA","info_description":"We explore a variety of research questions using Asian / Africa data to pursue questions that have broader relevance.

Accordingly, this Capstone course integrates content drawn from practice and research on establishing a business overseas and managing a multinational, as well as, an X-Culture SMU-X experiential exercise with a real company so the student:  1.\tUnderstands the topology of differences (cognitive, cultural, nation state, institutional, business systems, market economies, economic maturity, and geographic) that exists, particularly, among countries in Asia, and must be accommodated within an internationalised business model as SMEs/MNCs establish operations outside their home country.2.\tBuilds upon their prior courses, particularly business strategy, to understand the process of formulating and operationalising a strategy to internationalise towards foreign markets, as well as, the considerations and trade-offs when executing those steps. This will include an understanding of the roles and management interactions of locals versus expatriates, as well as, among host country subsidiaries, regional offices, and corporate headquarters. Emphasis is applied to understanding the strategic advantages possessed by a multinational; their ability to transfer such advantages from its home to host markets; as well as, the capacity of corporate headquarters to absorb new knowledge from its foreign operations in order to sustain and enhance its engagement within Asia. 3.\tExperiences what it is like to work in a MNC by applying a cross-disciplinary approach as a member of a global cross-cultural team.

Although many businesses have benefited from the new technology, more of them are being threatened or have been displaced by it. From now, digital technology will only proliferate at an exponential rate and businesses who cannot harness such capabilities will experience an accelerated erosion of their competitive advantages in productivity, product and service offerings, staff quality, consumer loyalty, and many other areas. Despite the urgent need for digital transformation, many businesses have slid into what Gartner documented as the “Trough of Disillusionment”. Many explanatory factors were offered and most centred around the confusion of what digital transformation actually entails. We define digital transformation as a movement centred around a digital-first thinking, as opposed to the misconceived technology-first or digital improvement approaches. A digital-first approach starts with a thorough understanding of the new paradigms of business strategy made possible by digital technologies, followed by a working understanding of the technologies involved, and most importantly, the organizational structure, teamwork, and culture that are necessary to support such endeavours. Digital transformation is not a patchwork of modular improvements designed for plug-and-play. It is a top-down, holistic, enlightened, determined, and dynamic (agile) movement aimed at persisting business performance. In this course, students will be given the opportunity to master digital-first thinking via our three prong approach. We start with the inculcation of new digital drivers of disruptive businesses through frameworks, toolkits, and discussions. Following which, we introduce the essential building blocks of digital-first thinking to transform business value propositions, improve decision making, optimize organizational structures and processes, and create a new working culture that is needed for a digital-first organisation. In the third part, we will attempt to synergize what we have learned and collectively create strategies and roadmaps for existing and new industries of the future.","info_instructors":["JACK HONG JIAJUN"]}},"MGMT733":{"name":"Engaging Students in Higher Education through a Rewarding Blended Learning Experience","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - DBA","info_units":0.25,"info_grading_basis":"Pass/Fail","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"LKCSB GPBA","info_description":"Educational blended learning approaches combine online digital media with traditional classroom methods.

This can be internal crises like organizational miscommunication, personality clashes; to external crises, for instance, arising from policy mismanagement to terrorism. Due to the vulnerability of the organization to both internal and external uncertainties, no organization is immune from crises. \n\nWhile organizations recognize the probability of the occurrence of crises, studies have shown that many do not have any preparation or plan to deal with them. Some do not find it necessary to take preventive measures; others simply do not know where to begin, and what to do. Indeed, strategic crisis management is a multifaceted discipline that involves components from issues management, crisis communication and management, conflict recovery and resolution. \n\nThis course aims to equip students with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, how to communicate during crises, and how to recover and learn from crises. The emphasis, thus, is on the preventive, rather than reactive, aspects of crisis management.\n\nScholars agree that crisis management is a dynamic, ongoing process, through a life cycle. Students will be taken through each step of the life cycle of a crisis, with the aim of helping them learn what they need to do at each phase. While many scholars have posited different frameworks, for this course, Wilcox, Cameron and Reber’s (2015) proactive-strategic-reactive-recovery framework is adopted because of its emphasis on the preventive aspects. \n\nIt is a useful course for those who wish to be equipped with knowledge for their work in public relations, consultancy, management, law, strategic communication, and public administration; or for those who wish to embark on research in these areas.","info_instructors":["AUGUSTINE PANG"]}},"COR3303":{"name":"Ethics and Social Responsibility for Law","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Law","info_academic_organization":"School of Law","info_description":"The objectives of this course are twofold: First, it is expected that students will learn the fundamental principles of influential ethical theories that have guided, or have been invoked by, explicitly or implicitly, governments, citizens, businesspersons and consumers, and other stakeholders in societies for centuries.

Yet, most communication efforts in organisations tend to be directed externally towards sales, integrated marketing, public and investor relations, etc. Internal communication is often misunderstood; rarely receives thorough planning; and is generally assumed as unnecessary as employees are expected to “follow instructions” and “obey orders”. Yet, it is broadly accepted that organisational success and productivity rely on effective communication between internal stakeholders. Recognising the importance of internal communication begins with the acknowledgement that organisations comprise sentient, thinking and diverse individuals who might not be readily agreeable and invariably obliging. Internal communication is fundamental as it can enable organisations to align missions and goals, cultivate common beliefs, coordinate activities, develop a shared identity and facilitate decision-making.

Science and Technology Studies (STS) is the interdisciplinary study of how science and technology shape society and the environment, and conversely, how society and the environment shape science and technology. Innovation and maturation, systems and regulation, risk and failure are the key notions that exemplify this dynamic relationship. In this course, we will analyze what science is, how it works, and how society provides the means and framework for scientific and technological knowledge. We will draw from various perspectives in the humanities and social sciences, including those of history, anthropology, sociology and public policy to explore different forms of interaction between science, technology, and society. In other words, we will examine the connections between scientific theories and practices, and our social, cultural, economic, and political lives. Specific topics covered include nuclear power and waste, regulation of the internet, data and self-hood, as well as climate change politics. The first unit introduces central ideas in Science and Technology Studies (STS). In unit two, we focus on assumptions and authority of science and technology, asking who benefits from how particular research agendas or new technologies are designed, and who bears the risks of living with uncertain science or dangerous technologies. The final unit explores controversial issues in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), and examines how policy-makers, scientists and STS scholars have addressed conflict and controversy.","info_instructors":["KSENIA TATARCHENKO"]}},"COR3302":{"name":"Ethics and Social Responsibility for Accounting","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Accountancy","info_academic_organization":"School of Accountancy","info_description":"This course discusses issues of ethics and social responsibility in the context of business in general as well as the accounting profession in particular.

It is a unique course which allows law students to acquire a different perspective of legal work through personalised interaction with senior Judges, working on actual cases and experiencing legal practice in real-life settings. 2.\tIn the course of the Clerkship Programme, the Clerks will be required to assist Judges with legal research and case analysis in cases involving more complex legal issues. The Clerks will experience the realities of court proceedings from observing court hearings and interacting with the Judges. From the vantage point of the decision-maker, the Clerks will get to experience first-hand the adjudication process of receiving and weighing relevant facts and evidence, assessing the credibility of witnesses, and persuasion by opposing parties. 3.\tThe Clerkship Programme will allow Clerks to practise and consolidate legal skills already acquired under the core curriculum through case research, writing and analysis. Through exposure to court litigation, the Clerks will be able to hone higher cognitive legal skills through critical analysis of facts, evidence, legal arguments and persuasion, as well as to gain a unique understanding of the critical processes in fact-finding and decision-making from a judicial perspective. Through interaction with Judges and other legal professionals, such as lawyers and court staff, the Clerk will learn higher level professional skills in communication and court craft, which are critical in their future careers as lawyers. The clerkship training will allow Clerks to learn the intricacies of various processes and rules in the context of judicial administration and engage in self-learning of substantive areas of law across disciplines. 4.\tAs the Clerkship Programme is intended to prepare the Clerks for life as a legal professional and takes place in a real world setting where court schedules are subject to change and other exigencies, the learning experience can be expected to be a rich and varied one.

The ‘data economy’ renders digitized information - promulgating at ever increasing speed – a valuable asset through the use of data analytics. It has also led to a fundamental shift in power and markets. The emergence of disruptive technological and business innovations is one prominent example of such a change. New economies are formed, such as from the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the development of ‘cognitive services’, the digitization of goods and the provision of storage/sharing and management services. Governments, including the Singapore public sector, are also aware of the importance of data to governance and to the future of the economy and are driving innovations and technology usage within that sector as well as in society generally through the Smart Nation initiative and Digital Economy drive. Substantial research and development are also encouraged in this field.\n\nThese fundamental shifts also lead to many problems and challenges related to different types of data and data sets. For Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and the data economy generally, cybersecurity is a major concern. In relation to personal data and digital communications, there are various threats to different forms of privacy. Other current issues surrounding data are the ‘fake news’ phenomenon and the persistent threats to intellectual property. On the flipside, these developments have also led to new industries (and careers) such as in the areas of cybersecurity and data protection.\n\nThe objective of this course is to prepare students who are interested in data protection law and may have an interest in making a career in this nascent industry that is set to grow. Students will first be introduced to the data economy as a concept and to the real changes to the market and to society as well as the various forms and categorisations of data and the legal aspects to these data sets. The second part of the course will then focus on privacy law and its relationship with data protection (DP) law. In this context, comparative study will be made of privacy and DP regimes of significance (e.g. OECD, EU, APEC, etc.). Third, students will then focus their study on the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (and other relevant laws) – in particular, the data protection and do not call provisions - by looking at its history, objective, scope/application and possible future developments e.g. Data Protection Ecosystem and PDPA Act Review. Comparative study of similar concepts and processes in other jurisdictions will also be assessed in the course of the study of the Singapore PDPA. The fundamental concepts and workings of the PDPA will be examined in depth. In the fourth part of the course, practitioners from the PDPC and the private sector will provide their perspectives on this process and a holistic and practical viewpoint to the study. \n\nAfter completing this course, students will be able to use what they have learnt to obtain professional certification such as from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) and PDPC with a view to practice in this area as a privacy counsel, privacy professional, manager and/or technologist. This will prepare students for a career in this growing field, or at least provide them with the skills and knowledge when dealing with such issues as a TMT lawyer, legal counsel or even as a general legal practitioner that will possibly encounter these issues at work.","info_instructors":["KAM WAI WARREN BARTHOLOMEW CHIK"," LANX GOH","Staff"]}},"LAW4010":{"name":"Legal Design","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Law","info_academic_organization":"School of Law","info_description":"Legal Design refers to the human centric redesign of legal services, processes and operations that helps legal organisations change and innovate, especially in the context of increasing technology adoption.

Thus, it is important that lawyers advising business firms understand these rules so they may help the clients to structure their transactions to maximize their benefits and minimize the costs. \n\nThis course will help the students to study the legal rules of the WTO, which cover tariff measures, antidumping and safeguard measures, food safety regulations, as well as domestic regulatory requirements. Using real WTO cases decided by the WTO tribunals as examples, the students will be able to critically examine how these rules are made, what are the impacts on business firms, how to argue the best case for their clients, and how these rules could be improved in the future. Taught by a former WTO staff member who is among a handful of people in the world who has worked on WTO cases at both Panel and Appellate Body levels as an insider, the students will also gain valuable insight into the WTO dispute settlement process, which arguably is the most important international tribunal in the world today. \n\nThe knowledge and skills learnt in this course will be helpful for students to explore a wide range of career options, including private law firms, government agencies (MFA, MTI), multinational companies, and international organizations (WTO, World Bank).","info_instructors":["HENRY GAO"]}},"LAW4003":{"name":"International and Comparative Secured Transactions Law","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Law","info_academic_organization":"School of Law","info_description":"It will provide a comparative analysis of the law of secured transactions in common and civil law jurisdictions with international instruments aiming to modernise secured transactions laws.

Policy involves the architecture of regulation – evoking rationality and secular bureaucracy. Religion, on the other hand, is rooted in ideology and ritual, and faith in things unseen. However, religion underpins not only most societies and cultures of Asia, but is also a key element in nation-state formation and identity. It wields formidable political clout. Furthermore, policy-making on religious matters is one of the most sensitive and contested areas of governance in contemporary Asia. In this course we will explore the rise and fall of the secularization thesis and the apparent rise of religiosity as a political force. We will closely examine and complicate the relationship between religion and the state, and we will explore ways in which religion impacts policy-making in seemingly ‘secular’ areas such as health-care, trade, and citizenship. We will examine the role of the state in managing religious diversity and multi-culturalism, touching also on its role in enforcing religious orthodoxy.
