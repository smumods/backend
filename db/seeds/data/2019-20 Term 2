This Study Mission course is aimed at inculcating a global mindset in students. Each year, a country which has important economic relationships with Singapore will be selected. The trip will provide students with a better understanding of economic policies and developments in the country visited. There will be visits to governmental agencies and corporations. Prior to the trip, students will work singly and in groups on research projects and cases.  Country experts and corporate executives will speak at seminars prior to and during the trip.Students will learn about the country’s economic policies, key industries, foreign direct investments, financial and banking sectors, capital market, and regulatory and tax regime. They will gain insights into how politics and culture impact the way businesses operate, business and investment opportunities in the country, and management strategies and practices of companies.  The trip will provide opportunities to interact with business leaders, and cultivate valuable networks. It will prepare students to be world ready.",

The analysis of empirical examples enables the consideration of demographic, cultural and ideological particularities, as well as nation-building efforts that vary across historical and geographical environments. This context-driven approach will also be taken towards the analysis of contemporary policy issues including citizenship, education and employment, including current debates such as disability in education and the ‘headscarf affair’. The course also includes an applied component which allows students to put the theories to use and to experience how to deal with diversity through three dialogue sessions outside the campus.",

Constructing Singapore’s history remains a struggle against competing notions of the state as a tool of British colonialism, an adjunct of Malaysia before its untimely expulsion, immigrants’ lay-over and Lee Kuan Yew’s political success. Since independence, Singapore’s leaders lament its lacking natural resources to justify their “pragmatic” management of the everyday lives of Singaporeans, including speech, educational environment, sexuality, religious expressions, ethnic identity and political culture, at the expense of citizens’ rights. Populated dominantly by ethnic Chinese with Malays and Indians as minorities, yet geographically surrounded by Muslim-majority nations have made the ruling PAP reluctant to observe multiracialism in governance policies which compromises the nation-building project. Presently, forces of globalisation threaten the state’s monopoly over political space and ideologies. This module targets students interested in developing a critical appreciation of the socio-economic and political contexts that structure Singaporeans’ daily lives. It highlights critical historical circumstances that shape Singapore’s post-independent governance policies, political discourses and contemporary development as a nation-state. It sharpens students’ sociological imagination as they deconstruct political ideologies to grasp alternative interpretations of the development of Singapore society and make sense of contemporary issues of importance in Singapore and to Singaporeans.",

The course will discuss extant research evidence on value investing strategies over the past decades. Students will then learn to develop their own statistical models and algorithms, in the context of a value-based investing framework, to predict financial performance and distress risk of firms as well as to uncover securities that can potentially generate superior investment returns. The course will involve writing programming codes to analyze large-scale archival data, draw inferences from the statistical results, and back-test the models for their predictive power. The advantages as well as pitfalls of such statistical models—including issues of data selection, and behavioral and institutional biases—will also be examined. The skills taught in this course would be useful for students who wish to pursue a career in securities analysis, asset management, investment analytics or financial consulting.",

However, instead of fearing this new technology, accountants should embrace these AI/ML/Analytics models and algorithms as enabling tools that liberate them from laborious tasks and allow them to focus on their core role of adding and delivering value to businesses.Given the heavy use of statistics in applying analytics to accounting data, this course aims to provide students with the foundation in statistical programming that is crucial to all 4 stages of analytics (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive). This course will focus on the use of R Programming to develop students’ statistical knowledge.

The term ‘back office’ is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today’s volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise. \n\nWith complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into ‘intelligent accounting functions’. \n\nIntelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities.\n\nThis accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects.",

No professional entering the field can expect to succeed in his or her career without a solid understanding and hands-on practice of analytical tools to help in making people decisions. To implement their business strategies effectively, leaders must deal with people issues in a way that allows them to gain competitive advantage through people. The organizations that will win the “war for talent” will be those which are better at identifying and keeping key talent, motivating high performance, developing and promoting staff and predicting future people needs accurately. HR professionals need analytics to address these challenges. For exam-ple, linking pay-for-performance has been a dogma of management, but recent research shows that most incentive plans do not produce the desired behavior, and that pay, in fact, has little correlation to business results. To succeed in the business world, it is imperative that HR provide data-driven answers and insights on how to implement and execute strategy through the people in the organization. The course provides students with practi-cal, hands-on approaches to connect HR policies and practices to business performance. You will review key statis-tics and finance concepts, such as ROI and people productivity; become familiar with available tools such as Workday and Tableau to complement Excel and others; discuss data collection, clean-up and warehousing; prac-tice building descriptive and predictive models; and get hands-on experience in applications for workforce planning, recruitment, compensation, training, career planning and turnover.

These challenges call for a multi-stakeholder approach involving shipping companies, port authorities/port development companies, regulators, financial institutions, research institutions, and other relevant partners. This course addresses the sustainability imperative for shipping and ports and the various solutions that are available to the different industry stakeholders. Indeed, the shipping and ports industries have started to respond to the growing environmental and social concerns of regulators, customers and the local communities in which they operate, while at the same time increasingly recognizing that sustainability may provide for new business opportunities and profitability.",

Warehouses are consolidation hubs of various products in a supply chain. To support business that covers a wide range of markets it is common for a warehouse to store hundreds of thousands of products. These products pass through the warehouse in huge volume daily, and so it is important to run it efficiently.\n\nBesides the traditional storage function, warehouses are increasingly forced to perform responsive and accurate customer order fulfillment and other value-added services. High performance in product warehousing and order fulfillment becomes crucial to the success of many companies in today's competitive business environment. We will introduce various operation models that are theoretically appealing and practically feasible. Some case studies will also be discussed.\n\nThis course is especially useful for those who are interested in consulting careers in logistics and supply chain management.",

Goods and services cannot move on their own from supply houses to demand locales, conferring transportation a central role in their distributions. Transportation contributes and increases the values in the chain by performing the \"moving\" functions in the physical distribution of products. In broader terms, transportation is often referred to as the lifelines of a nation and its economy because they are the preconditions for progress and development. Globalization complements trade and further magnifies the importance of efficient and effective transportation.  This course explores the business issues in the design and operations of transportation systems and underlines their strategic importance to firms and the economy. It discusses the core concepts and terminologies of road, air, rail and sea transportation, as well as, the role of international sourcing and logistics in contemporary supply chain management. When introducing the operational aspects of international logistics, the course also highlights the essentialities of international payment, documentation and insurances.",

The 21 economies of the largest trans-Pacific grouping, Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), account for nearly half of global trade. The region comprises not only the world’s ‘factory floor’ but also its most important sources of services, technology and investments, and final goods markets,” writes Peter Petri, an international trade economist.   Yet despite the much celebrated economic progress of the region and the potential to be reaped from it, there are clear strains and risks resulting from geopolitical and economic trends which impact businesses that operate here.  This course consists of a set of core lectures which will introduce students to: (a) economic, political and socio-cultural theories and frameworks for understanding the context of business in the Asia Pacific region; and (b) the application of international business theories and frameworks to understand the decision-making processes of companies investing in the region. Course participants are expected to apply theories and frameworks to assess business environments of specific Asian economies.  Participants are expected to analyse and make presentations about issues and challenges that are relevant to companies operating in large emerging economies such as China, India, Taiwan, and South Korea but also other economies such as Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.",

Design contexts refer to the broader emerging context for designs and business, specifically, society (including different cultures and the poor), and the physical environment. Learning will be primarily experiential in nature – through class discussion, group exercises, and a team project. Guest speakers with practical experience in Design Thinking may be invited as well.",

This course will directly help students in the execution of their research projects, in handling reviewer comments, and may help them to come up with novel research ideas. Students will gain hands-on experience in applying the methods discussed.\n\nThe course starts by introducing students to the various sources of quantitative data that may be encountered in marketing. More specifically, the course will cover questionnaire and experimental data, novel types of data such as data from eye tracking and text mining, and sources of secondary data such as consumer panels and scanner data. In addition, the differences between cross-sectional, temporal, and panel data will be discussed. Finally, the link will be made between the different sources and types of data and causality. Then, the focus will shift to data analysis. The data analysis part of Empirical Marketing Models will start with an introduction to SPSS and basic hypothesis testing. Next, regression models will be discussed. Students will gain hands-on experience in specifying and estimating linear additive and multiplicative marketing models, both in SPSS and in Stata, and will learn how to derive elasticities. Next, common problems, and their solutions, will be discussed, including multicollinearity, endogeneity, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity. Given that marketing data often comes in the form of panel data, e.g., transaction data for many customers over time, students will be introduced to random and fixed effects panel data models. Binary logistic regression models will form the next topic to allow students to analyse such variables as purchase incidence or coupon redemption. For new products no sales data are available. Conjoint analysis will be discussed as a solution to this problem. Cluster and factor analysis, two forms of multivariate data analysis, will be the next topics. Cluster analysis, or unsupervised machine learning, is an important tool for creating customer segments, and factor analysis is important when working with a (too) large number of correlated variables. Empirical Marketing Models will end with a discussion of various new developments in marketing models.",

The course also familiarises students with how best to present their market validation information and the initial outlines of their business and revenue models on social platforms and to early-stage investors.\n\nThe course will guide students in the process of developing and market-testing new venture ideas. Students will work in teams, and each team will receive a grant of $1,000 towards prototyping and market testing their new venture idea. Also, each student team will be assigned a mentor(s) to give the team feedback on their market testing process. A panel consisting of faculty instructor, industry experts, and entrepreneurs will select the teams for the course based on their one-page new business idea outline.\n\nThe student team business idea should be scalable, i.e., the aspiration of the student team should be to have at least 10 employees or $1 million in revenue within five years. If the business is a social entrepreneurship, a similar metric for social impact as appropriate will be necessary for admission into the course.  Student teams, as pre-formed, will remain the same for the duration of the course. Any disagreements within a team will have to be resolved by the team members themselves. \n\nThis course is not for students with more mature businesses; students who already have a business with finished products and/or services and with customers are encouraged to approach SMU-IIE for entry into the incubation program. \n\nThis course is not opened for bidding.

A weakness with this mindset is that it puts profits above all else and thereby ignores that companies are social organizations that serve employees, suppliers, and communities in which they operate. This profit-only mindset can raise significant problems when companies do not view their mission in a wider context, such as illustrated by BP and the oil spill disaster, and at worst be the seed of destruction for amoral firms like Enron. \n\nThis module explores the compelling reasons behind businesses taking on a broader role in developing social value that extends beyond the role of the firm as viewed by traditional economists. The module provides ideas, conceptual frameworks and tools to help students assess approaches to social value alignment and different models of interaction between corporations, governments, intergovernmental organizations, investors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). \n\nThis module is practitioner-oriented and intended to provide the participants with a basis for working with and advising business leaders in developing strategic social value alignment, and engage customers through social marketing, and build and understanding of firm level social strategy, dynamics of relationships between companies and stakeholders. Leaders of non-profit and government agencies will also find the module of benefit as it covers public-private relationships and will help identify how to work with business leaders on areas of business responsibility. \n\nSocial issues are wide a varied and include environmental management, health, education, social justice, labour standards, social mobility, climate change, and more. A full treatment of these topics is beyond the scope of this module. Instead, this module will provide broad frameworks and analytical tools for managing social value and stakeholder relationships, and provide illustrative examples though a guest speaker series to bring ideas to life. “Learning by doing” is the centre piece of this course which features a practicum style project where a team will work on realizing greater value for a firm they select to support.",

For those graduates who choose a start-up or SME, there is also a government initiative to encourage more Singaporean firms to establish operations overseas so it is important to understand the challenges and process of doing so. Accordingly, this Capstone course integrates content drawn from practice and research on establishing a business overseas and managing a multinational, as well as, an X-Culture SMU-X experiential exercise with a real company so the student:  1.\tUnderstands the topology of differences (cognitive, cultural, nation state, institutional, business systems, market economies, economic maturity, and geographic) that exists, particularly, among countries in Asia, and must be accommodated within an internationalised business model as SMEs/MNCs establish operations outside their home country.2.\tBuilds upon their prior courses, particularly business strategy, to understand the process of formulating and operationalising a strategy to internationalise towards foreign markets, as well as, the considerations and trade-offs when executing those steps. This will include an understanding of the roles and management interactions of locals versus expatriates, as well as, among host country subsidiaries, regional offices, and corporate headquarters. Emphasis is applied to understanding the strategic advantages possessed by a multinational; their ability to transfer such advantages from its home to host markets; as well as, the capacity of corporate headquarters to absorb new knowledge from its foreign operations in order to sustain and enhance its engagement within Asia. 3.\tExperiences what it is like to work in a MNC by applying a cross-disciplinary approach as a member of a global cross-cultural team. After all, reading a textbook does not allow a true appreciation of the reality of international cross-cultural business collaboration – one must experience it! You will apply both the course content and your accumulated academic knowledge at SMU in providing recommendations to a real-life SME as to a new market entry strategy (or similar assignment) encompassing market selection, entry method, marketing and operational considerations. As a participant in this global X-Culture initiative the SMU student will work in teams drawn among 5,000 students from 150 participating universities within 40 countries around the globe. After the successful completion of the exercise, in addition to the normal SMU grade, students will receive a X-Culture certificate, a performance report, and a recommendation letter reflecting your performance. The best teams will also be invited to the X-Culture Global Symposium held in July each year.Consistent with SMU’s experiential and formative teaching pedagogy, there will be three short quizzes throughout the term to promote greater knowledge retention (there is no final exam). In addition, you will choose your own local SMU teams to participate in the ‘Great SMU Debate’ and a case study prior to embarking on the X-Culture experiential exercise with your global teams during the second part of the course.",

As A.I. technology is already surpassing human decision- making in certain instances, there is growing concern about ‘uncontrolled A.I.’ in business and society, incl. regulatory and ethical-legal challenges. Against this background, this new course aims to equip students with foundational, theoretical and practical knowledge about A.I. driven business applications in selected private and public sector organizations. At the beginning of the course, students will watch Ex-Machina (2015), a psycho- techno thriller film which tells the story of a young programmer invited to the home of a reclusive billionaire to test whether an A.I. can pass itself off as human to assess the difficulties to successfully control and ‘switch- off’ artificial intelligence once created. Besides reconstructing the history of artificial intelligence from the 1960s to the current era (as well as a refresher about the basics of computer science algorithms such as audio and video compression algorithms), we will put emphasis on explaining the A.I. driven business models of several top international and local organizations such as New Relic, Splunk, Trade Desk, Nvidia, MetaMind, DBS, NTUC, Gov Tech Agency of Singapore and the German Research Center for A.I. In order to appreciate the power of A.I. technology, we will take a closer look ‘under the A.I. hood’ to understand what makes machine learning, deep learning, neural networks and image analysis tick. Visits to A.I. powered business organizations engaged in customer service management, finance, marketing, supply chain management or manufacturing will be organised aimed at appreciating both the benefits and downside of A.I. Students graduating from this course will be equipped with critical competencies to solve real-world business problems using A.I. technology while simultaneously casting a critical eye on the morality and ethics of commercialising A.I.",

Ultimately, the end outcome of IMC is its impact on the brand in terms of its ability to elevate brand awareness, brand recognition and ultimately brand preference and loyalty.

It is a required basic course for marketing majors, but it complements the theories and skills taught in many of the other majors at SMU.",

Different countries have different systems of capitalism and deal with this relationship in very different ways.  Because of these differences, specific systems and practices of corporate governance differ greatly around the world and in Asia. These differences, however, have been under pressure, as capital, management, and business practices become more global. Indeed, many Asian countries have revised their corporate governance system that is more consistent with global rules and expectations of investors who invest globally.   This course aims to make participants aware of the key issues that are related to corporate governance in especially the Asian context by examining corporate governance practices in various Asian countries and comparing them with non-Asian models, specifically the US and Germany.  Participants will be equipped with the conceptual frameworks and tools to understand and analyze the issues that are pertinent to corporate governance practices as well as their impacts on other issues such as firm performance, business ethics, and firm strategy.",

A significant part of the course will focus on Asia, but we will make comparisons with other developed and developing regions, especially given that much of the sustainability material is based on experiences and concepts from non-Asian regions. Environmental sustainability, and more generally, sustainability, has become increasingly important to developed and developing nations alike. The typical issues include resource scarcity and polluted environments, but the more recent issue of climate change has become a major issue. In contrast, sustainability issues in poorer regions usually involve human development concerns, such as reducing poverty and improving health and fulfilling other basic needs. Nearly half of the course will be on managing such issues of human development issues (and indirectly, their intertwined nature with environmental problems). Where possible, we will show the links between environmental sustainability and poverty. While solutions to these problems may require the involvement of the private sector (firms), the public sector (government) and the community, firms are increasingly called on to reduce their negative impacts on the environment and humans alike. The course will focus in particular on how business can address sustainability issues. Sustainability issues often consist of complex interactions between human activity and the environment. The course will apply several academic perspectives to characterizing these problems and their possible solutions. The course first examines how particular patterns of economic and social development are manifested in past practices and developmental paths, such as unsustainable patterns of urbanization and industrialization. The private sector is an integral part of many problems and solutions, and as such, will be the main focus of the course. An important part of addressing sustainability is the use of various frameworks to help incorporate a sustainability perspective into firms’ strategies and operations. These often employ a systems perspective. To help characterize firm’ sustainability and determine appropriate courses of action, the course will cover also specific managerial tools and frameworks that help to characterize sustainability challenges and incorporate them into corporate plans include the Triple Bottom Line, Life-Cycle Assessment, and the Base of the Pyramid approach and its business models. Where necessary, material on and links to concepts of strategy, business models, stakeholder engagement, public policy (in terms of governance), and innovation will be made.While many of the sustainability concepts have a Western origin, because of our location in Asia, and the increasing importance of sustainability to the local and regional context, especial attention has been paid to relating each section of the course to Asia, even as the original material (concepts and experiences) is covered from the (non-Asian) country or region of origin. This will be done through a series of cases and examples, especially for the part of the course covering industrialization- and poverty-related sustainability issues. Examples of Asia-specific material introduced in past classes and continued this year include material on the early phases of Japan’s industrialization and pollution and its eventual social-regulatory reforms; China’s ongoing sustainability problems as it continues to industrialize; China’s renewable energy policy and planning; agro-based eco-industrial parks (industrial ecosystems) in Turkey; the ongoing poverty issues in the region, and solutions (technological and otherwise) as practiced in India and Bangladesh); and finally, issues that Singapore faces. Similarly, the poor in the East and in other developing regions face many of the same issues as seen in other developing and developed regions, and so cross-comparisons between different regions can yield many lessons.",

Corporate strategy is the pattern of decision-making that determines a firm’s goals and objectives, produces principal policies, defines the range of business to pursue, and pertains to the overall plan for a diversified firm.  A firm’s corporate strategy acts as both a catalyst for and a constraint on the strategies of its business units.  If the business strategies do not support the firm’s corporate strategy, synergy becomes impossible.  Therefore, this progression reinforces the inextricable link between business strategy and corporate strategy, with cases of business integration, strategic alliances, corporate diversification, and mergers and acquisitions.  Drawing on these factors, the major objective of this course is to help student to understand: 1) conditions under which different types of corporate strategy have the potential to create (economic and social) value, competitive and corporate advantages; and 2) organizational and managerial systems that must be in place in order to realize this potential value creation.",

Student will be given 20 minutes in total (15 mins for presentation; 5 mins for Q&A) for their Session 6 presentation. \n\nThe success depends on active student attention to the material at hand. Attempts to integrate the material with other courses and/or student projects are welcome. Through this and other courses students should develop an appreciation for the varied trajectories of strategic management research, and start to plot positions for themselves on those trajectories. \n\nThe class, to the extent possible, will be student directed. For some portion of each class, one student will take responsibility for preparing and facilitating the class discussion. During the seminars, students will be asked to place ideas and concepts within the domain of strategy, in an attempt to foster the development of competing and/or complementary perspectives across varied disciplines or varied strategy problems.\n\nThe ultimate objective is to help future strategy teachers understand, appreciate, and use concepts from the field in their educational and scholarly pursuits.

        "info_description": "Much of marketing in the last half century has been about the single-minded satisfaction of consumer needs and wants. The key to success is thought to lie in thoroughly understanding what these needs and wants are and ensuring the best fit between what is offered as a product and what is desired. This market-led approach, unfortunately, is myopic in its neglect of other stakeholders, such as the environment and the community. This course takes an alternative perspective, premised on climate change, deterioration of the marine ecosystem, and social inequalities as realities. It first examines how current consumption patterns are harming the environment and communities. It then delves into what responsible consumption entails and how consumers can be influenced to make product choices that are sustainable. Theories in psychology will be drawn on to provide that understanding of consumer behaviour. The course will also examine what companies can do to ensure that their marketing activities are aligned with sustainability goals. Case studies of companies with strong sustainability initiatives will be used to illuminate current best practices.",

The empirical project is intended to provide you with a soft start on doing research with a problem of limited scope. The results of your empirical project can be used in your dissertation, obviously, it will be a small part of your dissertation if you eventually continue to work on the same topic. \nIn this course you will start to conduct research using empirical methods, which rely on observation and experimentation as a pilot project prior to embarking on your dissertation. This course will enable you to use empirical research methods in your field, with a topic and a data set that you will choose in collaboration with your advisor. If you do not have an advisor at this stage, you can work on your empirical project with any professor that you are interested in working with on research. Topics include the formulation of the question to be investigated and the creation of resulting hypotheses, the collection of data and the analysis of the data collected, and the interpretation and study of analysis results. The methods of data collection and the analysis of data depend on the needs of the research question (to be decided between you and the professor guiding you on the empirical project). These methods include but are not limited to one-on-one interviews, surveys and questionnaires, case study methods, and more involved econometric analysis if you have the right data set.

Innovation is often a continuous process. Sometimes organisations have a breakthrough product, but more often innovation is a continuous sequence of smaller improvements, recombining existing technologies into a new approach, and re-positioning existing solutions into new business models - all to enhance the value proposition for the customer in a significant way. \nInnovation and product development require creativity and imagination, but also hard work in the form of project management under uncertainty, improving the productivity of R&D, finding the best way to organise for speed and quality of the development cycle, profit management, etc. Being an innovator requires talent. \nThis course will not transform you into an innovator, but will help you hone your skills in managing the product development and innovation process. This course will familiarise you with how organisations manage the process of innovation and how they develop successful products, services and systems. The focus will be on innovation and product development in existing organisations. While we may touch on the topic of corporate entrepreneurship, this course is not about the start-up of new companies, nor is it a course on marketing of new products. The course is most valuable for those who want to work in industrial firms or do consulting work.\n\nPlease take note of the timings for the site visits and guest seminars indicated in the course outline.",

        "info_description": "This course will explore how ‘play’ can shape invention and innovative cultures. Inventors have been observed to be playfully conceiving new product designs and experiences in history as well as in technological innovation. The course investigates this link between play and invention through a broad treatment of the phenomena that examines historical and modern cultural domains (the historical treatment will comprise half or more of the examples). Play was borne out of not only of human desires for leisure and frivolity, but also necessity and cultural purposes, e.g. learning and community bonding respectively. We will broadly construe the forms of play relevant to invention to include not only the creation of playful artifacts, but also the playing around (or playfulness) observed in inventors’ actions, and the passions of inventors.\n\nThe course articulates the relationship between play and invention through both, study, and actual practice using creativity tools and design techniques. We illustrate the link between play and invention through studies of inventors’ life experiences, where their “playing” with concepts, technology and even cultural interpretations helped them to foster new ideas and inventions. Such play involves the creative combining of different concepts, which involves crossing boundaries between knowledge domains, and experimentation. In practicing the ‘play-to-invent’ relationship, we will cover creativity tools for ‘ideating’ concepts from diverse sources of knowledge, and design prototyping methods to flesh out and trial the ideas and concepts. In-class exercises and projects will serve as contexts for teaching and demonstrating these techniques. Note that while these techniques originate from the creative thinking and design fields, our goals are not to exercise sheer creativity for creativity’s sake, or to apply the full cycle of user-centered design thinking. \n\nTo reflect on how play is relevant to successful invention, we will cover a range of social scientific concepts for understanding play in theoretical terms, as well as how play has become relevant to culture. We will also contextualize our learning by covering a range of specific creative domains, including the visual arts, fashion, shopping, narrative, visual arts, food, and digital media. Key principles are highlighted in each domain and its designed forms to help understand how invention occurs within that domain, e.g. the nature of narrative in film, and the role of blends in cuisine. We also show how blends have occurred over historical time, such as when inventors made connections across domains as distantly-related as fashion, early London and Paris shopping galleries, American suburban malls and Disney theme parks; and those of early mechanical toys, computers, and musical instruments. Play facilitates creative blending by cross-fertilizing ideas from different domains, allowing ‘forms’ to transcend boundaries, and ultimately, to radically reshape leisure and culture. \n\nComparisons will be made between historical and modern ‘forms’, and examples will come from across continents, largely from European and American history. A significant part of the course will be a project to design innovative experiences or other ‘forms’ using the creative and design tools, and by incorporating the students’ understanding of the aesthetics and effects of play.",

More and more cities around the world are becoming increasingly popular as economic powerhouses and magnets for migrants from the countryside, suburban areas and other parts of the world. All big cities in both First and Third World countries as well as emerging markets such as New York, London, Tokyo, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Dehli, Jakarta etc. have to cope with high population density and serious challenges such as air pollution or traffic congestion. How do we pack more people into big cities and yet continue to achieve a high quality of life? How do we create and manage ‘good cities’ which are safe, spacious, green, connected, fair and resilient? How can cities create economic wealth while still fulfilling the CSR responsibilities of sustaining a “Green Planet”? What are the best practice designs and technical smart city solutions which could be leveraged to tackle these challenges and how can they be successfully commercialised? This course will provide answers to these questions with special emphasis on the managerial and commercial aspects of smart city concepts. \n\nThe key lies in creating and effectively managing innovative and sustainable, smart cities able to leverage on new technologies such as smart grids or sensor networks to create a place where people can live, play and work well. Starting from the stakeholder requirements of citizens and planners of innovative cities, the course will introduce students to urban design concepts as well as commercialization, management challenges and implementation issues of the smart city model. There will also be a focus on how good governance and enabling technologies such as sensor networks can facilitate the creation, management and sustainability of ‘good’ cities.\n \nWith the help of case studies and resource persons such as industry leaders, innovative city designers, tech experts and business development experts from local and int. companies such as ST Electronics, JTC, Jurong Consultants, Frost & Sullivan, IDA International, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) etc., students will be familiarized with the opportunities and challenges of the ‘smart city business’ which represents a key element in the value creation and extraction strategy of the Singapore Government and related businesses.",

These explorations will transpire through analysis and discussion of readings addressing economic, scientific, legal, philosophical, and aesthetic perspectives on the intersections of the global and local. By the end of the course, students will be expected to able to articulate their responses to whether they can find home in a globalised world by integrating the course material with their own personal experiences.

In this course, we will cover diverse fundamental methods and techniques across the themes of natural language processing, understanding and generation that are indispensable for constructing modern NLC systems. We will be focused on introducing and discussing the underlying computational models, data resources, toolkits, and practicing them in developing interactive information seeking, dialogue, and cross-language communication systems.

This can be internal crises like organizational miscommunication, personality clashes; to external crises, for instance, arising from policy mismanagement to terrorism. Due to the vulnerability of the organization to both internal and external uncertainties, no organization is immune from crises. \n\nWhile organizations recognize the probability of the occurrence of crises, studies have shown that many do not have any preparation or plan to deal with them. Some do not find it necessary to take preventive measures; others simply do not know where to begin, and what to do. Indeed, strategic crisis management is a multifaceted discipline that involves components from issues management, crisis communication and management, conflict recovery and resolution. \n\nThis course aims to equip students with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, how to communicate during crises, and how to recover and learn from crises. The emphasis, thus, is on the preventive, rather than reactive, aspects of crisis management.\n\nScholars agree that crisis management is a dynamic, ongoing process, through a life cycle. Students will be taken through each step of the life cycle of a crisis, with the aim of helping them learn what they need to do at each phase. While many scholars have posited different frameworks, for this course, Wilcox, Cameron and Reber’s (2015) proactive-strategic-reactive-recovery framework is adopted because of its emphasis on the preventive aspects. \n\nIt is a useful course for those who wish to be equipped with knowledge for their work in public relations, consultancy, management, law, strategic communication, and public administration; or for those who wish to embark on research in these areas.",

The importance of communicating strategically and the need for greater cross-cultural understanding have never been more critical for organisations struggling to effectively communicate with diverse stakeholder groups across different geographies in this new multi-polar business environment. This course aims to equip graduating communication students with the ability to apply theory and understand how strategic communication has evolved to influence the integration of paid, earned, shared and owned media which are vital to unearthing unique characteristics that drive communication practice in selected developed and developing nations in Asia. In addition to gaining insights from top Asian practitioners in the region, students will also acquire in-depth knowledge of the socio-political-cultural-economic factors that underpin the practice that influence business outcomes in the world’s most populous continent. This course will prepare students with a corporate communication major to readily transit and take on responsibilities to manage communication for businesses operating across Asia.",

With examples from domains such as transportation, economics, finance, and urban planning, we show how ABMS can help us better understand complex business and social phenomena. ABMS systems are particularly powerful if we want to describe a system populated by many independent and heterogeneous decision makers (who can be collaborators or competitors). ABMS systems can also be used in performing policy evaluations and generating decision supports, as we can then computationally test how changes in parameters at different levels would affect various performance indicators.\n\nBesides covering theoretic foundations of ABMS, we focus heavily on hands-on learning as well. In particular, we will expose students to NetLogo, an intuitive yet powerful modeling language for building ABMS systems. We will be learning NetLogo by building several classical ABMS examples incrementally in class.\n\nObjectives\nUpon successful completion of this course, a student will be able to:\n• Understand what is an ABMS.\n• Evaluate the pros and cons of using an ABMS system in describing selected real-world phenomena.\n• Utilize ABMS systems in policy/strategy evaluations.\n• Appreciate the importance of considering uncertainty and opponent modeling when designing strategic, tactic, and operational policies.\n• Complete the full cycle of building an ABMS system using the NetLogo programming language:\n  o Design an ABMS system with a proper level of granularity and fidelity (defining agents and means of communications).\n  o Validate and calibrate the built ABMS. \n  o Interpret the outcome of the ABMS system.",

Focusing on the history of the British Empire in Asia as a way of thinking around such issues, it uses imperial history as a lens into the development of ideas in environmental, medical and climatic science. It also considers the technological transformations that enabled and facilitated global imperial expansion. In so doing it considers imperialism’s role in environmental change in Asia; the transposition of scientific thought between West and East and, the evolution of environmentalism as a movement. It also seeks to promote interdisciplinary thinking about critical contemporary challenges by thinking through the complex historical interconnections of society, environment and science.",

First the complex relationship between society and climate. Whilst we are well aware today how humans have shaped our climate, the story of how climate has shaped us is less well understood. Climate has played a role in socio-political changes including the rise and fall of civilisations, to the shaping of socio-cultural traditions and customs. Second, it looks at the development of the science of climate and the meteorology. It explores climate science as a global phenomenon, influenced by scientific ideas and movements that circulated across borders and empires, but also as a response to local circumstances, especially extremes of weather. It also considers some of the broader challenges being faced because of climate change today and the role of the historian in current climate change debate. It has a particular focus on Asia and the exchange of knowledge about climate and weather between East and West.",

Once powerful countries in Europe are now fighting bankruptcy. The growth of the developing world which was taken for granted has begun to slow down. Even companies that were synonymous with their product categories just a few years ago are now no longer in existence.  Kodak, the inventor of the digital camera had to wind up its operations, Borders, once the second largest US bookstore, has shut down due to their inability to evolve their business models with the changing times. \n\nWith such momentous changes happening in the world today, this course prepares the students to better understand the complexity and difficulties in reacting to the ambiguity inherent in those changes. This course helps students to understand the tensions in a given situation and how they need to think through a problem from multiple dimensions.\n\nThe course aims to give students an insight into the mega trends and forces that are impacting their world. We ask what are some of the causes of these trends and their business implications? What can future managers like themselves do about understanding these changing trends, and why they need to address, appreciate, adapt and attempt to manage these changes in their ecosystem? The course aims to introduce some basic VUCA concepts, in order to broaden their world view of management and nature of managing complex problems. The first half of the course introduces some of these trends, while the second half provides tools and possible frameworks to deal with the VUCA aspects that they will face in the future.",

At the same time, it will sensitise them to the extent to which the wider social, political and economic context and a country’s underlying culture affect the implementation of constitutional rules and values. Evergreens like the separation of powers, constitutional enforcement and dilemmas in ensuring equality and dignity will be explored through comparative study of experiences in a diverse range of jurisdictions. Instead of exploring models and constitutional solutions in the abstract, the course invites students to explore the practical impact and outcomes particular constitutional models and ideas produce in everyday life. To that end, we will amongst others compare the constitutional responses that different countries provide to contemporary challenges such as how to ensure effective public participation in governance without encouraging populism; the pervasiveness of migration for our understanding of citizenship and its entitlements; ensuring that everyone is treated equally while respecting individual autonomy and life choices; the role of technology in public life and the implications for privacy and free speech; and the role of a constitution in fostering economic development.",

For example you might argue that you are the best candidate for promotion, about whether your company should invest in China, about the best way to help a friend or about what the right thing to do is in an ethical dilemma. The list is up to you. Increasingly in the 21st job market, you will need to think straight about any issue, even those unfamiliar to you. Recent surveys indicate that the most important skills employers are looking for are critical thinking and problem solving skills. We will teach you how to get better at reasoning and arguing in a way that can be applied to any subject matter. \n\nTopics covered include evaluating arguments, constructing arguments, reconstructing arguments, formalizing arguments, clarifying meaning and identifying common mistakes in argument (fallacies). At the end of the course you should be able to (1) identify the structures of real-life arguments in order to decide if they are good or bad, and (2) argue logically about things that matter to you. This course is specifically designed to improve writing, thinking and oral presentation skills that are applicable to all areas of academic study and relevant to working life. Careful application in this course will deepen your capacity to critically evaluate everyday practical scenarios and will help you ‘think outside the box’.",

The course employs both a theoretical and an experiential learning approach with the aim of fulfilling the objectives as outlined below.\n\nStudents will gain knowledge and skills about leadership development and team-building skills based on theories, principles, concepts, application, exercises/class activities, self-assessments/instruments, and experiential learning. \n\nCentral to the course is the action-based and experiential Group Project Assignment that offers an opportunity for students to work in groups to collaborate with a non-profit organization or profit-based organization that upholds community development and/or corporate social responsibility or sustainability initiatives1, that is, they initiate and act as idea champions to contribute to community with a project of their own and approach beneficiaries along the way to amend or improve on their ideas. Students are also free to work with any profit and/or non-profit organization on an existing or new project they may have, provided such opportunities exist and are offered to students.  \n\nAs idea champions, students work in groups, to develop/invent a prototype/model or mobile application or put into place a process, program or plan such as a business plan that will value-add and contribute to the needs of the beneficiary or organization of their choice. It is entirely up to the leadership of the organization concerned whether they would consider implementing or not implementing what students have designed. In other words, there is no compulsion for any organization to eventually sponsor the proposed ideas to the organization(s) concerned or may be collaborating with.\n\nThe outcomes of the group project for students are outlined as follows:\n(i) Students will learn about leadership from the leaders they are connecting with. For example, they will learn how and why today’s leaders are engaged in community-based or social initiatives in Singapore and beyond. \n(ii) Students will also learn from the leaders lessons on leadership and/or teamwork based on the leaders’ experiences.\n(iii) By undertaking a hands-on group project, students will also learn practical lessons as well as the complexities of teamwork based on their OWN experience and process of working internally, with their group mates and externally, with organizations outside of school.\n(iv) Each student will also reflect on his/her own learning throughout the project from start to end as outlined below (see ‘Reflection Essay’ for details).\n(v) Students will also fulfill other learning objectives that include cognitive and academic development as outlined below in the section, ‘Learning Objectives’",

Non-law students who are interested in philosophy or in thinking about law’s nature and its role in society will also have the opportunity to study these ideas as expounded by famous legal philosophers. \n\nWe will consider accounts of law offered by several legal positivists and modern natural law theorists, and challenges posed by alternative critical accounts. How do modern and critical accounts of law shape our thinking about the nature and purpose of law? How does adopting a particular account of law impact the practice of law? How can we, as lawyers or citizenry, harness law’s potential as a tool for transforming society?\n\nThrough this course, students will have a unique opportunity to engage their hearts and minds in relation to the concepts of law and justice. Students will also be encouraged to relate the theories studied to current contexts (e.g. laws that restrict personal liberty, unjust laws, how judges decide cases, and so on). The course's focus is on critique of ideas and not mere description of doctrine. The methods of assessment will be intentionally geared towards facilitating critical thought. This course encourages students to formulate their own theses about law and justice, and meaningfully understand their purpose in the legal process.\n\nThis course also offers law students a chance to study selected representative texts in jurisprudence in greater detail than in the law core module, Legal Theory & Philosophy.

It draws upon concepts from mathematics and computer science – more precisely, discrete mathematics, data structures and algorithm design. This course will hone students’ analytical skills as they are challenged to think abstractly and computationally. Their minds will be open to the wonders of computing, as they go behind the scene to unravel the fundamental analytics that empower Google, consulting agencies and service companies. NOTE: To facilitate learning in this course, you are required to know and use programming.  You are advised to pick up the Python programming language before the course, for instance by practising with online tutorials such as http://learnpython.org.By taking this course, students will:• discover the science of computing • model problems and learn practical problem-solving techniques to tackle complex computational problems (beyond what a spreadsheet is capable of solving)• apply problem-solving techniques to develop more elegant and efficient programs• learn to write programs to represent and manipulate with complex data objects• understand the challenge of scale, not only in dealing with large data sets, but also in appreciating the nature of computing and computability",

Through interdisciplinary perspectives from anthropology, geography, political economy, planning and cultural studies, we will explore diverse case studies, problems, politics and perspectives. Students will explore the possibilities and challenges of urban life over time and space – the centrality, complexity, creativity and conflicts that cities embody. The examination of cities will encompass spaces of social and cultural order/disorder, problems of social difference and the possibilities of creative responses, and the challenges and evolving meaning of individuality and collectivity in dense population spaces. Students will also examine contemporary global alternatives and pay special attention in readings to the urban experience in Singapore as the metropolitan laboratory in which we are active participants in creating and shaping. Through readings, focussed questions, discussions and assignments, students are also invited to reflect on the privileges and demands of urban citizenship itself.",

The same framework has subsequently been applied to the pricing and hedging of other more exotic financial products.\nThe course is an interesting mix of finance and mathematics. Students will see that fundamental financial concepts like the no-arbitrage principle, coupled with careful mathematical reasoning, lead to a sophisticated framework of valuation and hedging.\nThe mathematical tools employed are calculus, stochastic calculus, probability theory and numerical methods. A good background in calculus and probability is assumed. The other mathematical requisites will be furnished during the course.",

Participants in financial markets (investors, speculators, risk managers) all act on forecasts of asset returns and volatility. \n\nThis course covers the elements of economic forecasting. We cover both methods for generating economic forecasts, as well as for evaluating forecasts. The methods discussed are primarily ARMA and regression-based models, although some nonlinear techniques are also discussed. We will also discuss practical issues such as producing and evaluating multi-step ahead forecasts, dealing with misspecification, and using mixed frequency data. \n\nThe course is application-oriented. Participants in this course will work with actual data in realistic forecasting scenarios. We will use econometric software in applications, but no programming skill is required.",

Here, governmental expenditure programs such as programs on health care, social security and education come into focus. Finally, the module discusses the financing of government programs bringing into focus the taxation system. The efficiency and distributional effects of different taxes and their implication on the choice of financing method and on project evaluation are some of the issues that will be discussed here. An introduction to optimal taxation theory is also included here. From time to time, during the exposition of the module, reference will be made to the US experience and to the Singapore experience to provide the practical motivation underlying a number of the ideas covered.",

Its ever expansive rules now cover issues including trade in both industrial and agricultural products, trade in services, labor mobility, investment, free trade agreements, health and food safety, and a wide variety of domestic regulatory regimes. Thus, it is important that lawyers advising business firms understand these rules so they may help the clients to structure their transactions to maximize their benefits and minimize the costs. \n\nThis course will help the students to study the legal rules of the WTO, which cover tariff measures, antidumping and safeguard measures, food safety regulations, as well as domestic regulatory requirements. Using real WTO cases decided by the WTO tribunals as examples, the students will be able to critically examine how these rules are made, what are the impacts on business firms, how to argue the best case for their clients, and how these rules could be improved in the future. Taught by a former WTO staff member who is among a handful of people in the world who has worked on WTO cases at both Panel and Appellate Body levels as an insider, the students will also gain valuable insight into the WTO dispute settlement process, which arguably is the most important international tribunal in the world today. \n\nThe knowledge and skills learnt in this course will be helpful for students to explore a wide range of career options, including private law firms, government agencies (MFA, MTI), multinational companies, and international organizations (WTO, World Bank).",

The course will include close readings of the major texts of the time, in selected passages from English translations of The Analects, Mencius, Laozi/Daodejing, Zhuangzi, as well as passages from the Xunzi, Mozi, and Hanfeizi. From these readings we will endeavour an understanding of the most important differences between Western and Chinese philosophy in interpretation and worldview.

Religion, on the other hand, is rooted in ideology and ritual, and faith in things unseen. However, religion underpins not only most societies and cultures of Asia, but is also a key element in nation-state formation and identity. It wields formidable political clout. Furthermore, policy-making on religious matters is one of the most sensitive and contested areas of governance in contemporary Asia. In this course we will explore the rise and fall of the secularization thesis and the apparent rise of religiosity as a political force. We will closely examine and complicate the relationship between religion and the state, and we will explore ways in which religion impacts policy-making in seemingly ‘secular’ areas such as health-care, trade, and citizenship. We will examine the role of the state in managing religious diversity and multi-culturalism, touching also on its role in enforcing religious orthodoxy. Throughout this course we will seek to develop a nuanced and grounded understanding of the interplay between religion and policy in Asia.",

In discussing the works of individual political philosophers, our objective is not to study each thinker’s thought for its own sake but to investigate the fundamental concepts and questions they brought to the fore. We will regularly ground the abstract ideas we examine in empirical phenomena, both past and present.
