Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War  I  when  the  US  army  experimented  with  unmanned  aerial  torpedoes.  Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations.  Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various drone functionalities in order to critically assess drone technology and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of unmanned aerial vehicles. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors from three different SMU schools (LKCSB, SIS and SOL)  plus exposure to drone entrepreneurs  and  first-hand,  team-based  experiences  in  piloting  mini drones  within  the SMU campus.","info_instructors":["EUGENE TAN KHENG BOON"," KAN SIEW NING"," THOMAS MENKHOFF"]}},"IS613":{"name":"Cybersecurity Technology and Applications","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - IT in Business","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Information Systems","info_academic_organization":"School of Info Systems MITB","info_description":"This course provides an introduction to cybersecurity.

Students enrolled in the FTW200 will undertake the FTW200 series under the same instructor for five recurring weeks from Week 3 to Week 7 of the school term. Each component is a three-hour session.\n\nFTW201 Job Search Strategies\nJob search strategies will help students who have a general idea of their preferences or bias for certain type of job functions to explore deeper into the career of choice. Students have to perform due diligence and research the industry/job functions they are interested in and what the careers, occupation or their dream job entail and relate it back to their self-assessment and career plan. They need to conduct sufficient research into the companies of choice and how they could “navigate their way” into these companies and job functions. They also need to consider closing skills gaps, if any, and the career path and advancement. \n\nThis workshop introduces to students effective job search strategies, informational interviews, how to get insider’s information on industry and job function requirements.\n\nThe outcome is for students to make a more informed decision on their choice career and options available.\n\n\nFTW202 Resume and Cover Letter Writing \nThis workshop will equip students with the skills to write an effective Cover Letter and resume that will help them secure an internship – this is just the basic workshop as most 2nd years will not have sufficient internship or work experience to help them enhance their employability. Students will be exposed to different formats and the effective uses under various circumstances. They will be taught how to create a CV and the sections which are normally included in a CV and the contents to be featured under each section. Advanced CV writing will be taught as an elective in the 3rd or 4th year for those who want help and guidance to strengthen their CVs and start their job applications. \n\nThis workshop will focus on how to build a good resume as well as how to craft a resume and cover letter befitting to the industry and internship/job they are applying for. \n\n\nFTW203 Social Etiquette and Groom for Success\nThis workshop will deliver to students the knowledge of good personal hygiene and effective grooming and how to conduct themselves in professional and social setting. This workshop should spark their interest to discover themselves and how best to project a confident and professional image as coverage is wide and may not offer sufficient depth. Students are encouraged to do more research on their own or attend workshops which will give them the depth they desire. \n\n\nFTW204 Personal Branding and Networking Skills\nSMU has built a credible brand among the employers however, its brand attributes must also be reflected in its students. There are certain attributes that have attracted employers to SMU students, such as being articulate, innovative, intellectual curiosity, courage to challenge the status quo, adventuresome, skilful and resourceful. The emphasis should be for students to build a believable and consistent long-lasting personal brand with focus on core values for the workplace and in society, not just being well-groomed. \n\nNetworking skills are critical for students to succeed. To be effective networkers, they need to understand the acceptable decorum and etiquette for establishing business relationships and friendships; and the “how-tos” of maintaining contacts and building long-term relationships at work and play. \n\nThrough this workshop students can be more aware of developing and maintaining a consistent personal brand both in the online and offline world and become more comfortable in having conversations with other peers and professionals in both a social and work-based setting.\n\nFTW205 Interviewing Skills\nInterviews can be at times daunting and can be very stressful especially if the candidate walks into an interview without adequate preparation. Students can use the interview session to their advantage to impress the interviewers and present themselves as good potential hires.

Inventors have been observed to be playfully conceiving new product designs and experiences in history as well as in technological innovation. The course investigates this link between play and invention through a broad treatment of the phenomena that examines historical and modern cultural domains (the historical treatment will comprise half or more of the examples). Play was borne out of not only of human desires for leisure and frivolity, but also necessity and cultural purposes, e.g. learning and community bonding respectively. We will broadly construe the forms of play relevant to invention to include not only the creation of playful artifacts, but also the playing around (or playfulness) observed in inventors’ actions, and the passions of inventors.\n\nThe course articulates the relationship between play and invention through both, study, and actual practice using creativity tools and design techniques. We illustrate the link between play and invention through studies of inventors’ life experiences, where their “playing” with concepts, technology and even cultural interpretations helped them to foster new ideas and inventions. Such play involves the creative combining of different concepts, which involves crossing boundaries between knowledge domains, and experimentation. In practicing the ‘play-to-invent’ relationship, we will cover creativity tools for ‘ideating’ concepts from diverse sources of knowledge, and design prototyping methods to flesh out and trial the ideas and concepts. In-class exercises and projects will serve as contexts for teaching and demonstrating these techniques. Note that while these techniques originate from the creative thinking and design fields, our goals are not to exercise sheer creativity for creativity’s sake, or to apply the full cycle of user-centered design thinking. \n\nTo reflect on how play is relevant to successful invention, we will cover a range of social scientific concepts for understanding play in theoretical terms, as well as how play has become relevant to culture. We will also contextualize our learning by covering a range of specific creative domains, including the visual arts, fashion, shopping, narrative, visual arts, food, and digital media. Key principles are highlighted in each domain and its designed forms to help understand how invention occurs within that domain, e.g. the nature of narrative in film, and the role of blends in cuisine. We also show how blends have occurred over historical time, such as when inventors made connections across domains as distantly-related as fashion, early London and Paris shopping galleries, American suburban malls and Disney theme parks; and those of early mechanical toys, computers, and musical instruments. Play facilitates creative blending by cross-fertilizing ideas from different domains, allowing ‘forms’ to transcend boundaries, and ultimately, to radically reshape leisure and culture. \n\nComparisons will be made between historical and modern ‘forms’, and examples will come from across continents, largely from European and American history. A significant part of the course will be a project to design innovative experiences or other ‘forms’ using the creative and design tools, and by incorporating the students’ understanding of the aesthetics and effects of play.","info_instructors":["TED FEICHIN TSCHANG"]}},"COMM102":{"name":"Foundations in Strategic Communication","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"COMM102 is the core course of the communication management major.

For this reason, pitching can be both incredibly terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. \n\nUnderstanding the fundamentals as well as the mechanics of pitching will take you far towards successfully pitching your ideas. And there’s nothing like good, old-fashioned practice with plenty of feedback from peers and experts to help you hone your pitching skills. In this course, we will explore the fundamentals and mechanics of effective pitches and put into practice everything we are learning week by week towards becoming successful pitchers. \n\nWhile many people think of pitching as only useful for those who need to raise money (for example, a start-up pitch), pitching is actually an essential skill for reaching agreement on almost any subject. Agreement can yield many outcomes: management buy-in for developing a product or service, closing a sale, securing a partnership, recruiting an employee, securing an investment, and even securing employment for yourself. \n\nNancy Duarte, a communication specialist, put it this way: “Companies are started, products are launched, climate systems are saved – possibly based on the quality of presentations. Likewise, ideas, endeavours, and even careers can be cut short due to ineffective communication.” In this course, you will be given a good foundation for successful pitching so that no worthy idea or endeavour of yours will fall short simply because it wasn’t effectively conveyed.","info_instructors":["TOM ESTAD"]}},"COMM246":{"name":"Crisis Management and Communication","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"Organizations are, literally, experiencing and battling crises of some form or other every day. This can be internal crises like organizational miscommunication, personality clashes; to external crises, for instance, arising from policy mismanagement to terrorism. Due to the vulnerability of the organization to both internal and external uncertainties, no organization is immune from crises. \n\nWhile organizations recognize the probability of the occurrence of crises, studies have shown that many do not have any preparation or plan to deal with them. Some do not find it necessary to take preventive measures; others simply do not know where to begin, and what to do. Indeed, strategic crisis management is a multifaceted discipline that involves components from issues management, crisis communication and management, conflict recovery and resolution. \n\nThis course aims to equip students with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, how to communicate during crises, and how to recover and learn from crises. The emphasis, thus, is on the preventive, rather than reactive, aspects of crisis management.\n\nScholars agree that crisis management is a dynamic, ongoing process, through a life cycle. Students will be taken through each step of the life cycle of a crisis, with the aim of helping them learn what they need to do at each phase. While many scholars have posited different frameworks, for this course, Wilcox, Cameron and Reber’s (2015) proactive-strategic-reactive-recovery framework is adopted because of its emphasis on the preventive aspects. \n\nIt is a useful course for those who wish to be equipped with knowledge for their work in public relations, consultancy, management, law, strategic communication, and public administration; or for those who wish to embark on research in these areas.","info_instructors":["YEO SU LIN"]}},"COMM332":{"name":"Campaigning and Communication Planning","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"This course helps students fulfil a key employment requirement of the communication industry: the ability to strategically and at high speed develop communication campaigns that support the competitiveness, the reputation, the market access and the licence to operate of their organization.

Economic expansion or recession will change all business forecasts; market structure will affect profitability; fluctuating exchange rates will have an impact on costs, sales, risk perceptions and debt levels; and the state of the national budget or interest-rate decisions can color a company ́s future. In particular, a global recession like the one suffered recently can transform consumption behavior and business strategies. Managerial Economics provides students with a framework to understand the main economic variables and dynamics that affect business activity. Understanding the microeconomy is the first stepping-stone toward achieving a full grasp of the economic world that surrounds us. Most of the world ́s countries rely on free markets to make most of their economic decisions, and those markets automatically answer the key economic questions (What will we produce? How will we produce it? At what price? Who will get it?) through the operation of supply and demand. The course will review the basic concepts of supply, demand, market failures and externalities to provide a broad perspective on how free markets work. It will then move on to elasticity and market structures and their impact on profitability. The objective is to give students a firm understanding of how supply and demand at the micro-level determine the basic parameters of doing business. Yet markets are not perfect. In our times, a period of deregulation and strong faith in markets to solve economic problems has been followed by the deepest economic crisis since the early 20th century, with devastating effects on output, income and employment nearly everywhere. The experience has brought back to the fore the key questions of how economic decisions should be made, and how much governments should intervene when market failures exist, especially in light of pressing problems such as environmental deterioration which the market appears poorly equipped to solve. The second part of the course will focus on the macroeconomy and the policies that governments follow, and how the interaction between free economic forces and policy affect the business cycle and company prospects. It will begin by analyzing the key macroeconomic indicators --GDP, inflation and unemployment and the business cycle--, and evaluate how changes in these variables affect businesses. It will then outline the dynamics of the macroeconomy, the operation of fiscal and monetary policies and how and why policy decisions are made, to give students the tools to anticipate key policy decisions and understand their impact on the macroeconomy. Finally, the course moves from the micro and national levels to the global level, for a look at international trade, exchange rates and the balance of payments. It will detail the forces of trade, the determinants of exchange rates, and the important concepts underlying the balance of payments; and how all of those elements of the international economy affect business. In the process, we will encounter an explanation for the Great Contraction that occurred beginning in 2008, and will be able to understand how the crisis has and will change our economic lives.

Predictive analytics focus on what could happen in the future and typically uses statistical techniques, regression analysis, or machine learning algorithms to train a model to predict future outcomes. Predictive analytics attempts to make sense of data by finding patterns or fitting statistical models while simulation modeling attempts to mimic reality. Simulation can be used to analyze systems that have not yet existed. Many complex engineering, operations, and business systems can be modeled as discrete-event systems, including call center; manufacturing companies’ supply chain, hospital emergency rooms, airport terminals, and air traffic control systems. The complexity of the systems and the uncertain nature of the environment often make simulation the only feasible analytic tool to model and study the design and operations of these systems.\n\nSimulation modeling can help to maximize the effectiveness of decision making by examining alternative outcomes and scenarios, before, during and after process implementation or execution. As such, simulation can be used for modeling systems that are too expensive to build or too dangerous to experiment with in practice. “What if” analysis concerning the system can be posed to assess the impact of various alterations to the system. Powerful simulation software that allows realistic 3D models to be built with ease and support data analysis without needing sophisticated knowledge of statistics are available and increasingly more organizations are embracing such technology.\n\nThis course covers the modeling and simulation of the structure and behavior of real-world systems using discrete-event simulation techniques. You will be introduced to the application and theoretical background of simulation modeling.

Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War  I  when  the  US  army  experimented  with  unmanned  aerial  torpedoes.  Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations.  Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various drone functionalities in order to critically assess drone technology and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of unmanned aerial vehicles. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors from three different SMU schools (LKCSB, SIS and SOL)  plus exposure to drone entrepreneurs  and  first-hand,  team-based  experiences  in  piloting  mini drones  within  the SMU campus.","info_instructors":["EUGENE TAN KHENG BOON"," KAN SIEW NING"," THOMAS MENKHOFF"]}},"IDST713":{"name":"Independent Study","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - PhD Business (OM)","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"LKCSB GPO","info_description":"Each independent study is a one-on-one research tutorial between the student and a selected faculty, on a topic mutually agreed upon by the student and the faculty.

The term ‘back office’ is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today’s volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise. \n\nWith complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into ‘intelligent accounting functions’. \n\nIntelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities.\n\nThis accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects.","info_instructors":["PAN SHAN CHI"," GARY"," VENKY SHANKARARAMAN"]}},"FNCE210":{"name":"International Finance","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"This course introduces the principles of finance in an international context.

Advanced CV writing will be taught as an elective in the 3rd or 4th year for those who want help and guidance to strengthen their CVs and start their job applications. \n\nThis workshop will focus on how to build a good resume as well as how to craft a resume and cover letter befitting to the industry and internship/job they are applying for. \n\n\nFTW203 Social Etiquette and Groom for Success\nThis workshop will deliver to students the knowledge of good personal hygiene and effective grooming and how to conduct themselves in professional and social setting. This workshop should spark their interest to discover themselves and how best to project a confident and professional image as coverage is wide and may not offer sufficient depth. Students are encouraged to do more research on their own or attend workshops which will give them the depth they desire. \n\n\nFTW204 Personal Branding and Networking Skills\nSMU has built a credible brand among the employers however, its brand attributes must also be reflected in its students. There are certain attributes that have attracted employers to SMU students, such as being articulate, innovative, intellectual curiosity, courage to challenge the status quo, adventuresome, skilful and resourceful. The emphasis should be for students to build a believable and consistent long-lasting personal brand with focus on core values for the workplace and in society, not just being well-groomed. \n\nNetworking skills are critical for students to succeed. To be effective networkers, they need to understand the acceptable decorum and etiquette for establishing business relationships and friendships; and the “how-tos” of maintaining contacts and building long-term relationships at work and play. \n\nThrough this workshop students can be more aware of developing and maintaining a consistent personal brand both in the online and offline world and become more comfortable in having conversations with other peers and professionals in both a social and work-based setting.\n\nFTW205 Interviewing Skills\nInterviews can be at times daunting and can be very stressful especially if the candidate walks into an interview without adequate preparation. Students can use the interview session to their advantage to impress the interviewers and present themselves as good potential hires. The interview session is not only to secure an internship or job but also a two way communication to explore and discover whether there is a good fit between the candidate, the job and the organizational and candidate’s expectations. \n\nThe objective of this workshop is to help students understand the objectives of the interviews, the different types of interviews and equip and practice good interviewing and listening skills in preparation for the internship/job applications.","info_instructors":["CATHERINE ONG"," MAUREEN ONG","JILL LOWE"," JOANNE KOO HSIAW LYN","JILL LOWE"," STEVEN CHONG","CLEMENT ONG"," SUZENNE ZHENG","MARION TEO"," STEVEN CHONG","CHEE SZE YEN"," SUZENNE ZHENG","CHEE SZE YEN"," MARION TEO","CATHERINE ONG"," CLEMENT ONG","STEVEN CHONG"," SUSAN WONG MUN YEE","JOANNE KOO HSIAW LYN"," SUSAN WONG MUN YEE","JILL LOWE"," MAUREEN ONG","CLEMENT ONG"," SUSAN WONG MUN YEE","CATHERINE ONG"," JONATHAN KWAN"]}},"FNCE217":{"name":"Wealth Management and Advisory","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"The objective of this course is to introduce wealth management and advisory needs/focuses across client segments spanning from the mass-affluent space to the private high net-worth individual (HNWI) space.

However, with the large growth in private wealth globally and particularly in Asia, wealth  management for HNWIs is fast emerging. The course begins with a macro view onthe wealth management landscape before advancing to understand the similarities and differences between managing wealth for institutions versus for individuals. With individuals, we will appreciate the need for different investment products and wealth solutions across client segments based on needs and suitability. Students will learn how to risk profile a client using behavioural finance knowledge and models, prepare an investment policy statement (IPS) for a particular client’s profile and be able to suggest an asset allocation based on the IPS. As the life cycle stages of a client progresses, the wealth advisory approach must incorporate retirement planning.Students will learn the iterative wealth management and advisory process where client profiling, monitoring and review of investment portfolios, implementation and executions of the investment plans are conducted regularly and dynamically across the life cycle stages of a client.","info_instructors":["ERIC GOH"," MIKE HUE"]}},"FNCE201":{"name":"Corporate Finance","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"This course continues to develop the analytical skills for making corporate financial decisions as introduced in FNCE101.  The main objective of this course is to help students gain an in-depth knowledge of the major theories in corporate finance and their practical implications for thinking about real world issues.  The main topics covered are capital structure policy, corporate payout policy, advanced cost of capital and investment decisions, as well as various special topics, such as Mergers & Acquisitions.

Further, we will explore developments in key technology areas (artificial intelligence, big data, biotech, nanotech, ITC, internet security and space technology) and debate implications on Singapore’s transition into a knowledge- and innovation-based economy. Special topics on “Closed & Finite System Thinking”, “Non-linear Behavior”, “Culture” and “Risk Mitigation” complement the course. Trends are internalized through examples and a research project to ascertain a solid understanding of ongoing debates. Interest in the discussion of current world affairs and a passion for creating a better future are pre-requisites to succeed.","info_instructors":["FRANK SIEGFRIED"]}},"MGMT614A":{"name":"Corporate Strategy","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - CFO Leadership","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Accountancy","info_academic_organization":"SOA MCFO","info_description":"This course introduces students to the theoretical concepts and analytical tools required for formulating and implementing appropriate strategies that affect the enduring success of the entire organization.

A weakness with this mindset is that it puts profits above all else and thereby ignores that companies are social organizations that serve employees, suppliers, and communities in which they operate. This profit-only mindset can raise significant problems when companies do not view their mission in a wider context, such as illustrated by BP and the oil spill disaster, and at worst be the seed of destruction for amoral firms like Enron. \n\nThis module explores the compelling reasons behind businesses taking on a broader role in developing social value that extends beyond the role of the firm as viewed by traditional economists. The module provides ideas, conceptual frameworks and tools to help students assess approaches to social value alignment and different models of interaction between corporations, governments, intergovernmental organizations, investors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). \n\nThis module is practitioner-oriented and intended to provide the participants with a basis for working with and advising business leaders in developing strategic social value alignment, and engage customers through social marketing, and build and understanding of firm level social strategy, dynamics of relationships between companies and stakeholders. Leaders of non-profit and government agencies will also find the module of benefit as it covers public-private relationships and will help identify how to work with business leaders on areas of business responsibility. \n\nSocial issues are wide a varied and include environmental management, health, education, social justice, labour standards, social mobility, climate change, and more. A full treatment of these topics is beyond the scope of this module. Instead, this module will provide broad frameworks and analytical tools for managing social value and stakeholder relationships, and provide illustrative examples though a guest speaker series to bring ideas to life. “Learning by doing” is the centre piece of this course which features a practicum style project where a team will work on realizing greater value for a firm they select to support.","info_instructors":["Staff"]}},"MGMT222":{"name":"Family Business","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"Family businesses are the most prevalent form of business in the world.

One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster’s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners’ innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill.\n\nThis course should be of particular interest to people aspiring for a career in designing and managing for innovation, either directly (e.g., V.P. of R&D, R&D Manager) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course will also be useful to SME proprietors and entrepreneurs who intend to serve new markets, or use new technologies, or participants who wish to strategically reposition their offerings in an existing market. The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between innovation and business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources.","info_instructors":["SHANTANU BHATTACHARYA"]}},"MGMT205":{"name":"International Business","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"International Business is the study of the cross-border trade, investments and corporate functions by firms, and the role of national governments and international institutions in regulating these activities.  The course examines the objectives and strategies by multinationals in internationalization and the strategic choices in country locations, market entry, product/service offerings, organisational structure & human resource management.  Related topics include the international business environment (economic, cultural, political, legal), globalisation, foreign direct investments, licensing, franchising, foreign entry modes, strategic alliances, and regional economic integration.  The course will demonstrate the challenges for business and management in an international environment.","info_instructors":["JUDY TAN","Staff"]}},"MGMT218":{"name":"Entrepreneurship and Business Creation","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"This course is a core course for the Entrepreneurship track of the management concentration offered at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business.

A significant part of the course will focus on Asia, but we will make comparisons with other developed and developing regions, especially given that much of the sustainability material is based on experiences and concepts from non-Asian regions. Environmental sustainability, and more generally, sustainability, has become increasingly important to developed and developing nations alike. The typical issues include resource scarcity and polluted environments, but the more recent issue of climate change has become a major issue. In contrast, sustainability issues in poorer regions usually involve human development concerns, such as reducing poverty and improving health and fulfilling other basic needs. Nearly half of the course will be on managing such issues of human development issues (and indirectly, their intertwined nature with environmental problems). Where possible, we will show the links between environmental sustainability and poverty. While solutions to these problems may require the involvement of the private sector (firms), the public sector (government) and the community, firms are increasingly called on to reduce their negative impacts on the environment and humans alike. The course will focus in particular on how business can address sustainability issues. Sustainability issues often consist of complex interactions between human activity and the environment. The course will apply several academic perspectives to characterizing these problems and their possible solutions. The course first examines how particular patterns of economic and social development are manifested in past practices and developmental paths, such as unsustainable patterns of urbanization and industrialization. The private sector is an integral part of many problems and solutions, and as such, will be the main focus of the course. An important part of addressing sustainability is the use of various frameworks to help incorporate a sustainability perspective into firms’ strategies and operations. These often employ a systems perspective. To help characterize firm’ sustainability and determine appropriate courses of action, the course will cover also specific managerial tools and frameworks that help to characterize sustainability challenges and incorporate them into corporate plans include the Triple Bottom Line, Life-Cycle Assessment, and the Base of the Pyramid approach and its business models. Where necessary, material on and links to concepts of strategy, business models, stakeholder engagement, public policy (in terms of governance), and innovation will be made.While many of the sustainability concepts have a Western origin, because of our location in Asia, and the increasing importance of sustainability to the local and regional context, especial attention has been paid to relating each section of the course to Asia, even as the original material (concepts and experiences) is covered from the (non-Asian) country or region of origin. This will be done through a series of cases and examples, especially for the part of the course covering industrialization- and poverty-related sustainability issues. Examples of Asia-specific material introduced in past classes and continued this year include material on the early phases of Japan’s industrialization and pollution and its eventual social-regulatory reforms; China’s ongoing sustainability problems as it continues to industrialize; China’s renewable energy policy and planning; agro-based eco-industrial parks (industrial ecosystems) in Turkey; the ongoing poverty issues in the region, and solutions (technological and otherwise) as practiced in India and Bangladesh); and finally, issues that Singapore faces. Similarly, the poor in the East and in other developing regions face many of the same issues as seen in other developing and developed regions, and so cross-comparisons between different regions can yield many lessons.","info_instructors":["TED FEICHIN TSCHANG","Staff"]}},"MGMT237":{"name":"Corporate Strategy","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"This builds on the course 'Strategy'.  Corporate strategy is the pattern of decision-making that determines a firm’s goals and objectives, produces principal policies, defines the range of business to pursue, and pertains to the overall plan for a diversified firm.  A firm’s corporate strategy acts as both a catalyst for and a constraint on the strategies of its business units.  If the business strategies do not support the firm’s corporate strategy, synergy becomes impossible.  Therefore, this progression reinforces the inextricable link between business strategy and corporate strategy, with cases of business integration, strategic alliances, corporate diversification, and mergers and acquisitions.  Drawing on these factors, the major objective of this course is to help student to understand: 1) conditions under which different types of corporate strategy have the potential to create (economic and social) value, competitive and corporate advantages; and 2) organizational and managerial systems that must be in place in order to realize this potential value creation.","info_instructors":["KIM CHANG HYUN"]}},"MGMT320":{"name":"Innovations for Asia’s Smart Cities","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"The world is rapidly urbanizing.

Sometimes organisations have a breakthrough product, but more often innovation is a continuous sequence of smaller improvements, recombining existing technologies into a new approach, and re-positioning existing solutions into new business models - all to enhance the value proposition for the customer in a significant way. \nInnovation and product development require creativity and imagination, but also hard work in the form of project management under uncertainty, improving the productivity of R&D, finding the best way to organise for speed and quality of the development cycle, profit management, etc. Being an innovator requires talent. \nThis course will not transform you into an innovator, but will help you hone your skills in managing the product development and innovation process. This course will familiarise you with how organisations manage the process of innovation and how they develop successful products, services and systems. The focus will be on innovation and product development in existing organisations. While we may touch on the topic of corporate entrepreneurship, this course is not about the start-up of new companies, nor is it a course on marketing of new products.

This can be internal crises like organizational miscommunication, personality clashes; to external crises, for instance, arising from policy mismanagement to terrorism. Due to the vulnerability of the organization to both internal and external uncertainties, no organization is immune from crises. \n\nWhile organizations recognize the probability of the occurrence of crises, studies have shown that many do not have any preparation or plan to deal with them. Some do not find it necessary to take preventive measures; others simply do not know where to begin, and what to do. Indeed, strategic crisis management is a multifaceted discipline that involves components from issues management, crisis communication and management, conflict recovery and resolution. \n\nThis course aims to equip students with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, how to communicate during crises, and how to recover and learn from crises. The emphasis, thus, is on the preventive, rather than reactive, aspects of crisis management.\n\nScholars agree that crisis management is a dynamic, ongoing process, through a life cycle. Students will be taken through each step of the life cycle of a crisis, with the aim of helping them learn what they need to do at each phase. While many scholars have posited different frameworks, for this course, Wilcox, Cameron and Reber’s (2015) proactive-strategic-reactive-recovery framework is adopted because of its emphasis on the preventive aspects. \n\nIt is a useful course for those who wish to be equipped with knowledge for their work in public relations, consultancy, management, law, strategic communication, and public administration; or for those who wish to embark on research in these areas.","info_instructors":["YEO SU LIN"]}},"COMM301":{"name":"Data Analytics and Visualization for Communication Management","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"In a career in management, it is required for one to communicate with data by analyzing information in order to make effective decisions and get optimal results.  Managers also use data to convey a persuasive story to stakeholders.  This course introduces students to (1) essential quantitative reasoning and skill sets of analyzing data to make informed managerial decisions, (2) illustrations of how real-world decision makers often engage in errors and biases in their quantitative reasoning, and (3) ways to perform evidence-based business communication and make informed decisions.  This course presents the essential concepts underlying quantitative analysis as a way of thinking—beyond a way of computing—in order to develop analytic decision-making abilities.  The course covers fundamental concepts and statistical techniques in the context of real-world business settings.  Students will use R for all statistical data analysis and presentation.","info_instructors":["SUNGJONG ROH"]}},"COMM332":{"name":"Campaigning and Communication Planning","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"This course helps students fulfil a key employment requirement of the communication industry: the ability to strategically and at high speed develop communication campaigns that support the competitiveness, the reputation, the market access and the licence to operate of their organization.

We begin our study with questions of the demand for fiat money, go on to introduce banking and financial intermediation, and finally look at the effects of money on saving, investment, and output.","info_instructors":["HOON HIAN TECK","Staff"]}},"ECON735":{"name":"Advances in the Singapore Economy and Innovation","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - DBA","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"LKCSB GPBA","info_description":"Singapore became independent on 9 August 1965. Its per capita income was only about US$500, about the same as Mexico and S. Africa then. By 2015, its per capita income was US$56,000, similar to Germany and the US. Its economic journey began with its dependence on entrepot trade and heavy dependence on the expenditure of British bases. Today it is a global city state: a little red dot, but a global brand.\n\nSingapore is ranked by the World Bank as the easiest place in the world to do business and by the Heritage Foundation and the freest economy in the world, after Hong Kong. There are virtually no import tariffs, no export subsidies, no exchange restrictions, no price ceilings, no minimum wage, no rent control. Income tax rates are among the lowest in the world, and government expenditure as a percentage of GDP well below most countries.\n\nSingapore’s leadership over the last 50 years can best be described as innovative and entrepreneurial in their policy making. Like China, careful choice and grooming of political leaders plus an orderly succession have provided the political stability and confidence for investors, resulting in rising standards of living.\n\nSingapore’s policy approach is both pragmatic – an emphasis on what works in practice rather than abstract theory; and eclectic – a willingness to adopt best practices from around the world. Market principles and signals guide its policies such as industrial policy, medical insurance, congestion pricing, social security, regulation of utilities, or allocation of land. Nevertheless, its Government does not hesitate to intervene when markets fail. State-owned enterprises continue to exist and thrive but they are run on market principles and are not allowed endless State subsidies.\n\nWelfare programs exist but are minimal so that work incentives are not eroded. Housing, health and education are subsidized.\n\nGoing forward, Singapore faces substantial challenges: a rapidly aging population, the political necessity to limit immigrant workers, declining exports and productivity, loss of competitiveness and inequality. Its leaders are searching for a new paradigm of growth.","info_instructors":["AUGUSTINE TAN HUI HENG"]}},"ECON237":{"name":"Advanced Macroeconomics","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Economics","info_academic_organization":"School of Economics","info_description":"The aim of this course is to twofold.

This prompts the question: Why are some countries rich and others poor? From around 1870 until the Second World War, Japan’s income per capita remained around 25 percent of U.S. income per capita. After the substantial reforms put in place at the end of the war, Japanese relative income rose sharply so that today Japanese standard of living is roughly two-thirds that of the U.S. level. The rapid catch-up was also achieved in the post-war period by several other Asian economies including Singapore. What is it that makes it possible for countries to produce growth miracles? For much of world history, people lived at subsistence levels well described by Thomas Malthus. Around the nineteenth century, however, there was an escape from Malthusian stagnation beginning in Europe. What is the engine of economic growth? Gasoline contributes to air pollution as it powers our cars. The release of carbon dioxide as oil and gasoline are burned contributes to global warming.

The growth of international trade has given rise to a corresponding increase in the number of transnational commercial disputes. Commercial parties desire a swift, practical and cost-effective resolution of such disputes. National legal systems were designed primarily to manage intra-jurisdictional disputes and were perhaps not particularly well-equipped to deal with cross-border disputes. \n\nInternational arbitration has provided a big part of the answer and serves as a primary if not default means of resolving transnational commercial disputes today. More recently, the courts in a number of jurisdictions have also innovated to fit into the changed dispute resolution landscape. They have established specialized international commercial courts such as in Dubai, and most recently, in Singapore as viable alternatives to international arbitration, depending on the parties’ particular needs. \n\nAny student with interest in pursuing a career in international commercial dispute resolution needs to have a good grasp of the process of the creation of commercial law and how they are enforced through various dispute resolution mechanisms.  The objectives of the course are to equip students with a working knowledge of the Singapore International Commercial Court, as well as prepare students to practise in the field of international arbitration. Course content is roughly divided equally between international commercial dispute resolution and international arbitration. \n\nThe part of the course on international arbitration will be focused on practical aspects of international arbitration procedure.

As the activities of corporations often transcend national frontiers and the consequences of such activities can be felt in a great number of States, there is increasing awareness that some form of supranational regulation of corporations is necessary in certain areas such as the protection of human rights and the environment and the fight against corruption. \n\nDuring the same period, business and human rights has emerged as a distinct field. The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (2011), for example, define a corporate responsibility to respect human rights. In response to growing pressure to address human rights issues, some transnational companies have begun to conduct human rights due diligence and integrate human rights considerations in corporate policies and practices. \n\nDrawing on international standards, industry case studies, legal proceedings, the work of international organizations, and a growing academic literature, course explores the theoretical difficulties in securing corporate responsibility for human rights abuses within the framework of transnational law; as well as the practical aspects of enforcing such responsibility in international and national courts and tribunals, with a particular focus on the Southeast Asian region. ","info_instructors":["MAHDEV MOHAN"]}},"LAW429":{"name":"Corporate Insolvency Law","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Law","info_academic_organization":"School of Law","info_description":"Insolvency law is concerned with debtors who are unable to repay their debts.

Second, in analysing capitalism, we adopt a long historical view that traces the emergence of its fundamental logics and global expanse back to the eighteenth century.

This shift in paradigm is driven by increasing stakeholder demands and performance expectations as well as growing public scrutiny after some spectacular corporate failures around the globe. \n\nWhile the board of directors holds statutory responsibility for effective governance, risk management and assurance, it is expected that appropriate GRA frameworks, policies and procedures are in place to ensure these accountabilities are working. In the context of sound board oversight, the Code of Corporate Governance (2012) prescribes that the CEO and CFO provide the board of directors with an annual assurance regarding the effectiveness of the company’s risk management and internal control systems. This places the CFO with prime responsibility to over GRA frameworks and practices.\n\nThe purposes of this course are to provide participants with an overview of governance principles to achieve corporate objectives; the essentials of risk management to respond to threats affecting these objectives; and lastly, assurance principles and practices to assure the integrity of the governance and risk management frameworks.  GRA is more than merely a set  of policies, systems, processes and practices. Its fundamental thrust is to inculcate a culture of doing the right thing within the business and societal contexts. \n\nThis course adopts complementary strategic and stakeholders’ perspectives of GRA. The stakeholder approach is designed to expose participants to the conflicting roles, influence, power and objectives of the parties that contribute to the corporation’s’ value creation process. \n\nParticipants will study the GRA framework to create and preserve corporate values (see below) and their importance in achieving corporate objectives. \n\nTopics covered include corporate governance models (including code), risk management (e.g. ISO 31000, COSO) and relevant assurance frameworks as well as analytical tools for effective GRA practices.

The term ‘back office’ is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today’s volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise. \n\nWith complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into ‘intelligent accounting functions’. \n\nIntelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities.\n\nThis accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects.","info_instructors":["PAN SHAN CHI"," GARY"," VENKY SHANKARARAMAN"]}},"OBHR612":{"name":"Research in Human Resources","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - PhD Business (OBHR)","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"LKCSB GPO","info_description":"This course covers methods and findings in classic and contemporary research on human resources management.

Digitization refers to the power of new digital technologies and business models which can lead to the decline and eventual disappearance of existing goods and services. A major challenge related to demographic change is the trend towards a rapidly ageing population. Both trends affect a particular component of diversity, namely age diversity, and thereby generational issues such as perceived differences between older and younger people in terms of values, communication priorities; age discrimination or the initiation of new types of social (‘digital’) behaviours transmitted from the plugged-in ‘Generation Z’ (born 1996 and after) to Baby Boomers (born 1946 to 1964). These three challenges (positioned at the interface of both current and future issues) are not only globally relevant but also have significant local implications for Singapore. \n\nEmbedded in the experiential SMU-X initiative, the Transformative Leadership course provides students with a unique learning opportunity to develop and implement (socially) innovative approaches which leverage digital technologies in order to make a positive impact on both demographic change and the way age diversity matters are managed in business and society in close collaboration with reputable partners in business, nonprofits and government. Learners will be paired up with external SMU-X partners to work on relevant innovative projects with real impact. \n\nAn example of a thematically related learning project from the finance sector is OCBC Bank's so-called “Life-App Day” where student \"technology ambassadors” introduced mature employees (aged 50 and above) to apps aimed at enhancing digital and financial technology learning as well as financial planning skills. A slightly more challenging project goal could be to create new urban (learning) spaces for members of Singapore’s increasingly multi-generational population cum workforce to share, learn, play, exercise, co-create and/or innovate, for example, to study and mitigate the effects of climate change on ‘us’. Another, even more demanding project approach might focus on leveraging ideas generated in the health sciences with regard to extending one’s ‘health span’ (a term which refers to the length of time that a person is healthy—not just alive) with the help of digital technology such as wearables in order to improve the quality of life by reducing the rate of ageing on the basis of preventive behavioural change strategies (as suggested by longevity scientists).

Group Project Assignment) for more project examples.\n\nThe successful completion of such transformative SMU-X projects requires learners diving deep(er) into various disciplines such as technology, social sciences, business, political governance, public policy, demography, gerontology etc. It is expected that the chosen practical challenges commissioned by SMU-X partners will ‘stretch’ students, forcing them to step out of their comfort zones and to explore the unknowns in order to make a ‘real’ difference ‘out there’ in both the social and business sectors. \n\nTo come up with innovative solutions, students will be introduced to “design thinking” which has been defined by Tim Brown (President and CEO of the award-winning global design firm IDEO) as a “human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.”\n\nIn terms of effective leader development, the SMU-X course design will support learners in expanding their individual capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Emphasis will be put on proximal indicators of leader development such as self-views around self-concept, including leader self-awareness, leadership self-efficacy and leader identity (besides regular leadership competencies) which will be measured, assessed and discussed on the basis of scientifically proven measures. Through their SMU-X projects, students will appreciate the importance of leadership development so that they can articulate what it takes for teams and their leaders to create strong(er) alignment and high(er) levels of commitment. The latter requires interpersonal trust, care and concern as well as shared mind-sets regarding (transformative) goals and values such as the ‘real’ sharing propelled by collaborative leadership approaches.\n\nPotential SMU-X project partners include the SMU-TCS iCity Lab, the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), Eu Yan Sang International (EYSI), Maybank Singapore, StarHub, onemakergroup and the Council for Third Age (C3A).","info_instructors":["KAN SIEW NING"," THOMAS MENKHOFF"]}},"OPIM707":{"name":"Topics in Manufacturing and Service Operations Management","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - PhD Business (OM)","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"LKCSB GPO","info_description":"The purpose of this course is to introduce the literature on online and omni-channel retailing.

A significant part of the course will focus on Asia, but we will make comparisons with other developed and developing regions, especially given that much of the sustainability material is based on experiences and concepts from non-Asian regions. Environmental sustainability, and more generally, sustainability, has become increasingly important to developed and developing nations alike. The typical issues include resource scarcity and polluted environments, but the more recent issue of climate change has become a major issue. In contrast, sustainability issues in poorer regions usually involve human development concerns, such as reducing poverty and improving health and fulfilling other basic needs. Nearly half of the course will be on managing such issues of human development issues (and indirectly, their intertwined nature with environmental problems). Where possible, we will show the links between environmental sustainability and poverty. While solutions to these problems may require the involvement of the private sector (firms), the public sector (government) and the community, firms are increasingly called on to reduce their negative impacts on the environment and humans alike. The course will focus in particular on how business can address sustainability issues. Sustainability issues often consist of complex interactions between human activity and the environment. The course will apply several academic perspectives to characterizing these problems and their possible solutions. The course first examines how particular patterns of economic and social development are manifested in past practices and developmental paths, such as unsustainable patterns of urbanization and industrialization. The private sector is an integral part of many problems and solutions, and as such, will be the main focus of the course. An important part of addressing sustainability is the use of various frameworks to help incorporate a sustainability perspective into firms’ strategies and operations. These often employ a systems perspective. To help characterize firm’ sustainability and determine appropriate courses of action, the course will cover also specific managerial tools and frameworks that help to characterize sustainability challenges and incorporate them into corporate plans include the Triple Bottom Line, Life-Cycle Assessment, and the Base of the Pyramid approach and its business models. Where necessary, material on and links to concepts of strategy, business models, stakeholder engagement, public policy (in terms of governance), and innovation will be made.While many of the sustainability concepts have a Western origin, because of our location in Asia, and the increasing importance of sustainability to the local and regional context, especial attention has been paid to relating each section of the course to Asia, even as the original material (concepts and experiences) is covered from the (non-Asian) country or region of origin. This will be done through a series of cases and examples, especially for the part of the course covering industrialization- and poverty-related sustainability issues. Examples of Asia-specific material introduced in past classes and continued this year include material on the early phases of Japan’s industrialization and pollution and its eventual social-regulatory reforms; China’s ongoing sustainability problems as it continues to industrialize; China’s renewable energy policy and planning; agro-based eco-industrial parks (industrial ecosystems) in Turkey; the ongoing poverty issues in the region, and solutions (technological and otherwise) as practiced in India and Bangladesh); and finally, issues that Singapore faces. Similarly, the poor in the East and in other developing regions face many of the same issues as seen in other developing and developed regions, and so cross-comparisons between different regions can yield many lessons.","info_instructors":["TED FEICHIN TSCHANG","Staff"]}},"MGMT304":{"name":"Entrepreneurial Leadership in Ethnic Chinese Business","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"Since the mid-1980s intra-regional trade and investment links in East and Southeast Asia have expanded rapidly with the shift of production by firms from Japan and newly industrializing countries to lower-cost, neighboring countries.

Inventors have been observed to be playfully conceiving new product designs and experiences in history as well as in technological innovation. The course investigates this link between play and invention through a broad treatment of the phenomena that examines historical and modern cultural domains (the historical treatment will comprise half or more of the examples). Play was borne out of not only of human desires for leisure and frivolity, but also necessity and cultural purposes, e.g. learning and community bonding respectively. We will broadly construe the forms of play relevant to invention to include not only the creation of playful artifacts, but also the playing around (or playfulness) observed in inventors’ actions, and the passions of inventors.\n\nThe course articulates the relationship between play and invention through both, study, and actual practice using creativity tools and design techniques. We illustrate the link between play and invention through studies of inventors’ life experiences, where their “playing” with concepts, technology and even cultural interpretations helped them to foster new ideas and inventions. Such play involves the creative combining of different concepts, which involves crossing boundaries between knowledge domains, and experimentation. In practicing the ‘play-to-invent’ relationship, we will cover creativity tools for ‘ideating’ concepts from diverse sources of knowledge, and design prototyping methods to flesh out and trial the ideas and concepts. In-class exercises and projects will serve as contexts for teaching and demonstrating these techniques. Note that while these techniques originate from the creative thinking and design fields, our goals are not to exercise sheer creativity for creativity’s sake, or to apply the full cycle of user-centered design thinking. \n\nTo reflect on how play is relevant to successful invention, we will cover a range of social scientific concepts for understanding play in theoretical terms, as well as how play has become relevant to culture. We will also contextualize our learning by covering a range of specific creative domains, including the visual arts, fashion, shopping, narrative, visual arts, food, and digital media. Key principles are highlighted in each domain and its designed forms to help understand how invention occurs within that domain, e.g. the nature of narrative in film, and the role of blends in cuisine. We also show how blends have occurred over historical time, such as when inventors made connections across domains as distantly-related as fashion, early London and Paris shopping galleries, American suburban malls and Disney theme parks; and those of early mechanical toys, computers, and musical instruments. Play facilitates creative blending by cross-fertilizing ideas from different domains, allowing ‘forms’ to transcend boundaries, and ultimately, to radically reshape leisure and culture. \n\nComparisons will be made between historical and modern ‘forms’, and examples will come from across continents, largely from European and American history. A significant part of the course will be a project to design innovative experiences or other ‘forms’ using the creative and design tools, and by incorporating the students’ understanding of the aesthetics and effects of play.","info_instructors":["TED FEICHIN TSCHANG"]}},"JPAN201":{"name":"Japanese","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Social Sciences","info_academic_organization":"School of Social Sciences","info_description":"Japanese is designed for students with no previous background in Japanese.

As of the end of 2013, the notional amount of outstanding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives totalled $710 trillion. This phenomenal growth can be attributed to the fact that there is a genuine need for financial risk management. Structured products are financial instruments created based on options and derivatives, tailored to the specific needs of the clients. Global businesses are exposed to movements in exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Structured products designed to effectively transfer these market sensitivities for effective risk management serve a real purpose and are consequently in high demand.

This prompts the question: Why are some countries rich and others poor? From around 1870 until the Second World War, Japan’s income per capita remained around 25 percent of U.S. income per capita. After the substantial reforms put in place at the end of the war, Japanese relative income rose sharply so that today Japanese standard of living is roughly two-thirds that of the U.S. level. The rapid catch-up was also achieved in the post-war period by several other Asian economies including Singapore. What is it that makes it possible for countries to produce growth miracles? For much of world history, people lived at subsistence levels well described by Thomas Malthus. Around the nineteenth century, however, there was an escape from Malthusian stagnation beginning in Europe. What is the engine of economic growth? Gasoline contributes to air pollution as it powers our cars. The release of carbon dioxide as oil and gasoline are burned contributes to global warming. What is the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality?

Whilst we are well aware today how humans have shaped our climate, the story of how climate has shaped us is less well understood. Climate has played a role in socio-political changes including the rise and fall of civilisations, to the shaping of socio-cultural traditions and customs. Second, it looks at the development of the science of climate and the meteorology. It explores climate science as a global phenomenon, influenced by scientific ideas and movements that circulated across borders and empires, but also as a response to local circumstances, especially extremes of weather. It also considers some of the broader challenges being faced because of climate change today and the role of the historian in current climate change debate. It has a particular focus on Asia and the exchange of knowledge about climate and weather between East and West.","info_instructors":["FIONA CLARE WILLIAMSON"]}},"IS616":{"name":"Internship","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - IT in Business","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Information Systems","info_academic_organization":"School of Info Systems MITB","info_description":"Students may do an internship in a company for 10 to 12 weeks.

Students trained by this course are expected to have developed the abilities to (i) process and analyze data from various social networks; (ii) discover knowledge from social media and social networks; and (iii) apply the knowledge they have discovered on business problems.\n\nThis course first introduces Python programming, as Python is the preliminary programming language used in this course. With enough skills on the programming language, students are taught on building crawlers to get data from social networks. Such data include both social media data and social network data. However, social network data may not be as explicit as social media data due to the fact that different social networks structure their data about their customers and relationships among customers including customers’ behaviors in different ways. Students need to understand such differences, and extract social networks from various aspects that they deem important and relevant to some business applications in mind.\n\nThere are two categories of data mining techniques to be introduced for social media data and social network data respectively, namely, text mining techniques to analyze topics and sentiments of social media, and graph mining techniques to analyze structures of social networks. The main focus of this course is on graph mining techniques over text mining techniques since there is already an elective for text mining – text analytics and application (B.7). Since graph theory is not taught for undergraduate programs in most universities, this course will spend some time to get students familiarized with graph theory before introducing graph mining techniques.\n\nPlenty of social analytics methods originate from graph mining techniques, students should first understand these techniques in order to apply these methods appropriately on social networks. In general, students will develop the ability to abstract social networks into graph models, and to extend graph algorithms to applications on social networks. Besides graph mining techniques, this course will also discuss social influence and social links which are more unique to social networks than graphs. There are also three advanced topics including ego networks and community detection catered for modern social networks analytics.\n\nLast but not least, students are expected to apply a mixture between text mining algorithms and graph mining algorithms on social media and social network data, with some business applications they have already in mind when extracting social networks, as their course projects to demonstrate a set of full-stack abilities from developments to analytics, knowledge discovery, and even further to business applications.","info_instructors":["FANG YUAN"]}},"IDST713":{"name":"Independent Study","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - PhD Business (OM)","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"LKCSB GPO","info_description":"Each independent study is a one-on-one research tutorial between the student and a selected faculty, on a topic mutually agreed upon by the student and the faculty.

In the context of sound board oversight, the Code of Corporate Governance (2012) prescribes that the CEO and CFO provide the board of directors with an annual assurance regarding the effectiveness of the company’s risk management and internal control systems. This places the CFO with prime responsibility to over GRA frameworks and practices.\n\nThe purposes of this course are to provide participants with an overview of governance principles to achieve corporate objectives; the essentials of risk management to respond to threats affecting these objectives; and lastly, assurance principles and practices to assure the integrity of the governance and risk management frameworks.  GRA is more than merely a set  of policies, systems, processes and practices.

The term ‘back office’ is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today’s volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise. \n\nWith complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into ‘intelligent accounting functions’. \n\nIntelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities.\n\nThis accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects.","info_instructors":["BENJAMIN LEE"]}},"FNCE210":{"name":"International Finance","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"This course introduces the principles of finance in an international context.

Digitization refers to the power of new digital technologies and business models which can lead to the decline and eventual disappearance of existing goods and services. A major challenge related to demographic change is the trend towards a rapidly ageing population. Both trends affect a particular component of diversity, namely age diversity, and thereby generational issues such as perceived differences between older and younger people in terms of values, communication priorities; age discrimination or the initiation of new types of social (‘digital’) behaviours transmitted from the plugged-in ‘Generation Z’ (born 1996 and after) to Baby Boomers (born 1946 to 1964). These three challenges (positioned at the interface of both current and future issues) are not only globally relevant but also have significant local implications for Singapore. \n\nEmbedded in the experiential SMU-X initiative, the Transformative Leadership course provides students with a unique learning opportunity to develop and implement (socially) innovative approaches which leverage digital technologies in order to make a positive impact on both demographic change and the way age diversity matters are managed in business and society in close collaboration with reputable partners in business, nonprofits and government. Learners will be paired up with external SMU-X partners to work on relevant innovative projects with real impact. \n\nAn example of a thematically related learning project from the finance sector is OCBC Bank's so-called “Life-App Day” where student \"technology ambassadors” introduced mature employees (aged 50 and above) to apps aimed at enhancing digital and financial technology learning as well as financial planning skills. A slightly more challenging project goal could be to create new urban (learning) spaces for members of Singapore’s increasingly multi-generational population cum workforce to share, learn, play, exercise, co-create and/or innovate, for example, to study and mitigate the effects of climate change on ‘us’. Another, even more demanding project approach might focus on leveraging ideas generated in the health sciences with regard to extending one’s ‘health span’ (a term which refers to the length of time that a person is healthy—not just alive) with the help of digital technology such as wearables in order to improve the quality of life by reducing the rate of ageing on the basis of preventive behavioural change strategies (as suggested by longevity scientists). Please refer to page 3 (B. Group Project Assignment) for more project examples.\n\nThe successful completion of such transformative SMU-X projects requires learners diving deep(er) into various disciplines such as technology, social sciences, business, political governance, public policy, demography, gerontology etc. It is expected that the chosen practical challenges commissioned by SMU-X partners will ‘stretch’ students, forcing them to step out of their comfort zones and to explore the unknowns in order to make a ‘real’ difference ‘out there’ in both the social and business sectors. \n\nTo come up with innovative solutions, students will be introduced to “design thinking” which has been defined by Tim Brown (President and CEO of the award-winning global design firm IDEO) as a “human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.”\n\nIn terms of effective leader development, the SMU-X course design will support learners in expanding their individual capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Emphasis will be put on proximal indicators of leader development such as self-views around self-concept, including leader self-awareness, leadership self-efficacy and leader identity (besides regular leadership competencies) which will be measured, assessed and discussed on the basis of scientifically proven measures. Through their SMU-X projects, students will appreciate the importance of leadership development so that they can articulate what it takes for teams and their leaders to create strong(er) alignment and high(er) levels of commitment. The latter requires interpersonal trust, care and concern as well as shared mind-sets regarding (transformative) goals and values such as the ‘real’ sharing propelled by collaborative leadership approaches.\n\nPotential SMU-X project partners include the SMU-TCS iCity Lab, the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), Eu Yan Sang International (EYSI), Maybank Singapore, StarHub, onemakergroup and the Council for Third Age (C3A).","info_instructors":["KAN SIEW NING"," THOMAS MENKHOFF"]}},"OBHR203":{"name":"Personnel Selection","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"This course focuses on the attraction, recruitment, and selection of employees into organizations.  This course is designed to provide students with a broad overview of the field of personnel selection by exposing them to a variety of theories, concepts, findings, and unresolved issues within this area.  An organizing theme, which cuts across the diverse topic areas covered in this course, is the commitment to empirical methods that currently characterize the fields of human resource management and organizational behavior.  Students will learn current scientific theories of management as well as “best management practices” as identified and demonstrated by leading organizations.  Students will learn how to develop and administer effective staffing procedures to achieve sustained competitive advantage for organizations.","info_instructors":["FILIP LIEVENS"]}},"OPIM703":{"name":"Dynamic Programming","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - PhD Business (OM)","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"LKCSB GPO","info_description":"This course covers the theory and application of dynamic programming (DP), i.e. optimal sequential decision making in the presence of uncertainty.

A weakness with this mindset is that it puts profits above all else and thereby ignores that companies are social organizations that serve employees, suppliers, and communities in which they operate.

The module provides ideas, conceptual frameworks and tools to help students assess approaches to social value alignment and different models of interaction between corporations, governments, intergovernmental organizations, investors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). \n\nThis module is practitioner-oriented and intended to provide the participants with a basis for working with and advising business leaders in developing strategic social value alignment, and engage customers through social marketing, and build and understanding of firm level social strategy, dynamics of relationships between companies and stakeholders.

However, companies that are able to strategically change their entrenched ways of doing things and then reclaim leading positions are the exception rather than the rule. This course discusses how companies can effectively manage the strategic change that has significant impact on the way it is configured for competitive advantage. It emphasizes that established companies must engage in entrepreneurial process to find ways to create value continuously. The focus of the course is on the strategic-level decision making with rich discussion on individual- and cognitive-level management in change process. Emphasizing the practicality, the course features discussion on technological innovation and e-commerce that impose both challenges and opportunities for strategic change management in the increasingly technology-based, internet-based, and data-based business contexts. Case analysis is the main pedagogical approach in this course. There would be significant calculation involved in the case analysis, which requires some basic understanding of business management, introductory economics, and introductory accounting. \n\nThis is a good additional elective to the Business Core course MGMT 102 Strategy.

As A.I. technology is already surpassing human decision- making in certain instances, there is growing concern about ‘uncontrolled A.I.’ in business and society, incl. regulatory and ethical-legal challenges. Against this background, this new course aims to equip students with foundational, theoretical and practical knowledge about A.I. driven business applications in selected private and public sector organizations. At the beginning of the course, students will watch Ex-Machina (2015), a psycho- techno thriller film which tells the story of a young programmer invited to the home of a reclusive billionaire to test whether an A.I. can pass itself off as human to assess the difficulties to successfully control and ‘switch- off’ artificial intelligence once created. Besides reconstructing the history of artificial intelligence from the 1960s to the current era (as well as a refresher about the basics of computer science algorithms such as audio and video compression algorithms), we will put emphasis on explaining the A.I. driven business models of several top international and local organizations such as New Relic, Splunk, Trade Desk, Nvidia, MetaMind, DBS, NTUC, Gov Tech Agency of Singapore and the German Research Center for A.I.

A significant part of the course will focus on Asia, but we will make comparisons with other developed and developing regions, especially given that much of the sustainability material is based on experiences and concepts from non-Asian regions. Environmental sustainability, and more generally, sustainability, has become increasingly important to developed and developing nations alike. The typical issues include resource scarcity and polluted environments, but the more recent issue of climate change has become a major issue. In contrast, sustainability issues in poorer regions usually involve human development concerns, such as reducing poverty and improving health and fulfilling other basic needs. Nearly half of the course will be on managing such issues of human development issues (and indirectly, their intertwined nature with environmental problems). Where possible, we will show the links between environmental sustainability and poverty. While solutions to these problems may require the involvement of the private sector (firms), the public sector (government) and the community, firms are increasingly called on to reduce their negative impacts on the environment and humans alike. The course will focus in particular on how business can address sustainability issues. Sustainability issues often consist of complex interactions between human activity and the environment. The course will apply several academic perspectives to characterizing these problems and their possible solutions. The course first examines how particular patterns of economic and social development are manifested in past practices and developmental paths, such as unsustainable patterns of urbanization and industrialization. The private sector is an integral part of many problems and solutions, and as such, will be the main focus of the course. An important part of addressing sustainability is the use of various frameworks to help incorporate a sustainability perspective into firms’ strategies and operations. These often employ a systems perspective. To help characterize firm’ sustainability and determine appropriate courses of action, the course will cover also specific managerial tools and frameworks that help to characterize sustainability challenges and incorporate them into corporate plans include the Triple Bottom Line, Life-Cycle Assessment, and the Base of the Pyramid approach and its business models. Where necessary, material on and links to concepts of strategy, business models, stakeholder engagement, public policy (in terms of governance), and innovation will be made.While many of the sustainability concepts have a Western origin, because of our location in Asia, and the increasing importance of sustainability to the local and regional context, especial attention has been paid to relating each section of the course to Asia, even as the original material (concepts and experiences) is covered from the (non-Asian) country or region of origin. This will be done through a series of cases and examples, especially for the part of the course covering industrialization- and poverty-related sustainability issues. Examples of Asia-specific material introduced in past classes and continued this year include material on the early phases of Japan’s industrialization and pollution and its eventual social-regulatory reforms; China’s ongoing sustainability problems as it continues to industrialize; China’s renewable energy policy and planning; agro-based eco-industrial parks (industrial ecosystems) in Turkey; the ongoing poverty issues in the region, and solutions (technological and otherwise) as practiced in India and Bangladesh); and finally, issues that Singapore faces. Similarly, the poor in the East and in other developing regions face many of the same issues as seen in other developing and developed regions, and so cross-comparisons between different regions can yield many lessons.","info_instructors":["TED FEICHIN TSCHANG","Staff"]}},"MGMT706":{"name":"International Business Theories","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - PhD Business (SMO)","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"LKCSB GPO","info_description":"The goal of this course is to provide a solid theoretical basis for further research in International Business and Management.

To examine this in a one-week timeframe, we will focus on the development of infrastructure, real estate (housing), education and health care.\n \nResource-rich environments attract investors, but managing today in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia where governments are sensitive to issues of competitive and strategic sustainability, raises challenges.  Having moved from low income status to low middle-middle income status, Indonesia and Malaysia face the challenge of avoiding the “middle-income trap,” the situation where developing economies’ convergence to the development frontier comes to a halt once their income per capita reaches a middle-income level.  In contrast, Singapore surmounted that challenged, but now as an advanced market economy, it faces the challenge of a small, high wage country (5.5 million): the need to innovate to remain competitive at this level.","info_instructors":["TAN CHIN TIONG"]}},"MGMT319":{"name":"Management of Technology and Innovation","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"For their long-term survival, all organisations need to innovate their product and/or service portfolios, as well as how they organise their processes.

Inventors have been observed to be playfully conceiving new product designs and experiences in history as well as in technological innovation. The course investigates this link between play and invention through a broad treatment of the phenomena that examines historical and modern cultural domains (the historical treatment will comprise half or more of the examples). Play was borne out of not only of human desires for leisure and frivolity, but also necessity and cultural purposes, e.g. learning and community bonding respectively. We will broadly construe the forms of play relevant to invention to include not only the creation of playful artifacts, but also the playing around (or playfulness) observed in inventors’ actions, and the passions of inventors.\n\nThe course articulates the relationship between play and invention through both, study, and actual practice using creativity tools and design techniques. We illustrate the link between play and invention through studies of inventors’ life experiences, where their “playing” with concepts, technology and even cultural interpretations helped them to foster new ideas and inventions. Such play involves the creative combining of different concepts, which involves crossing boundaries between knowledge domains, and experimentation. In practicing the ‘play-to-invent’ relationship, we will cover creativity tools for ‘ideating’ concepts from diverse sources of knowledge, and design prototyping methods to flesh out and trial the ideas and concepts. In-class exercises and projects will serve as contexts for teaching and demonstrating these techniques. Note that while these techniques originate from the creative thinking and design fields, our goals are not to exercise sheer creativity for creativity’s sake, or to apply the full cycle of user-centered design thinking. \n\nTo reflect on how play is relevant to successful invention, we will cover a range of social scientific concepts for understanding play in theoretical terms, as well as how play has become relevant to culture. We will also contextualize our learning by covering a range of specific creative domains, including the visual arts, fashion, shopping, narrative, visual arts, food, and digital media. Key principles are highlighted in each domain and its designed forms to help understand how invention occurs within that domain, e.g. the nature of narrative in film, and the role of blends in cuisine. We also show how blends have occurred over historical time, such as when inventors made connections across domains as distantly-related as fashion, early London and Paris shopping galleries, American suburban malls and Disney theme parks; and those of early mechanical toys, computers, and musical instruments. Play facilitates creative blending by cross-fertilizing ideas from different domains, allowing ‘forms’ to transcend boundaries, and ultimately, to radically reshape leisure and culture. \n\nComparisons will be made between historical and modern ‘forms’, and examples will come from across continents, largely from European and American history. A significant part of the course will be a project to design innovative experiences or other ‘forms’ using the creative and design tools, and by incorporating the students’ understanding of the aesthetics and effects of play.","info_instructors":["TED FEICHIN TSCHANG"]}},"JPAN201":{"name":"Japanese","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Social Sciences","info_academic_organization":"School of Social Sciences","info_description":"Japanese is designed for students with no previous background in Japanese.

It will also provide an understanding of the wider national and international environments in which international trade takes place, including product liability laws, major methods of resolving trade disputes, and important regulatory issues, such as WTO rules, and laws on customs, competition, technology transfer and security.","info_instructors":["PASHA HSIEH","Staff"]}},"LAW303":{"name":"Law of Equity & Trusts","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.5,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Law","info_academic_organization":"School of Law","info_description":"As the common law developed the institution of the contract, the courts of equity gave rise to the institution of the trust.

Students of the course will have the opportunity to analyse contemporary environmental policy cases and learn about the policy design experience from experts of the field who will be invited as guest speakers to the classroom.  Some topics that are covered in the course include: policy cycles; policy tool classifications; simple vs. complex tool mixes; policy instrument calibrations; procedural instruments; nudges and nodality tools; regulations and authority-based instruments; organizational tools and tools for co-production and collaborative government.","info_instructors":["ISHANI MUKHERJEE","Staff"]}},"POSC401":{"name":"Senior Thesis in Political Issue","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":2.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Social Sciences","info_academic_organization":"School of Social Sciences","info_description":"The Senior Thesis in Political Science is an intensive course designed for BSocSci students who have declared Political Science as their primary major and are seriously planning to pursue graduate studies in Political Science.  Students will conduct an original empirical research study under the supervision of a Political Science faculty.  Eligible students should first approach a relevant Political Science faculty and secure his or her agreement to supervise the thesis before bidding for the course.  The student will be actively involved in all stages of the entire empirical research process including formulation of research question, literature review, design of study, development of measurement and procedures, data collection, data analysis, and writing up of the final thesis report.  Students will complete the thesis over two consecutive terms, typically in their senior year.  Students will submit their final thesis report two weeks before the oral defense of the thesis to a thesis committee.  The oral defense will typically be held on the week before the university’s final examination week.  The final grade for the thesis is based on the thesis report and the oral defense.  Students may also be required to present the findings of the thesis research to faculty members and other students in seminars held after the University’s final examinations.","info_instructors":["ONUR ULAS INCE","JACOB RICKS"]}},"PSYC208":{"name":"Psychology Research Methods II","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Social Sciences","info_academic_organization":"School of Social Sciences","info_description":"This course builds on the methodological concepts and procedures discussed in PSYC110 Psychology Research Methods I.

Students enrolled in the FTW200 will undertake the FTW200 series under the same instructor for five recurring weeks from Week 3 to Week 7 of the school term. Each component is a three-hour session.\n\nFTW201 Job Search Strategies\nJob search strategies will help students who have a general idea of their preferences or bias for certain type of job functions to explore deeper into the career of choice. Students have to perform due diligence and research the industry/job functions they are interested in and what the careers, occupation or their dream job entail and relate it back to their self-assessment and career plan. They need to conduct sufficient research into the companies of choice and how they could “navigate their way” into these companies and job functions. They also need to consider closing skills gaps, if any, and the career path and advancement. \n\nThis workshop introduces to students effective job search strategies, informational interviews, how to get insider’s information on industry and job function requirements.\n\nThe outcome is for students to make a more informed decision on their choice career and options available.\n\n\nFTW202 Resume and Cover Letter Writing \nThis workshop will equip students with the skills to write an effective Cover Letter and resume that will help them secure an internship – this is just the basic workshop as most 2nd years will not have sufficient internship or work experience to help them enhance their employability. Students will be exposed to different formats and the effective uses under various circumstances. They will be taught how to create a CV and the sections which are normally included in a CV and the contents to be featured under each section. Advanced CV writing will be taught as an elective in the 3rd or 4th year for those who want help and guidance to strengthen their CVs and start their job applications. \n\nThis workshop will focus on how to build a good resume as well as how to craft a resume and cover letter befitting to the industry and internship/job they are applying for. \n\n\nFTW203 Social Etiquette and Groom for Success\nThis workshop will deliver to students the knowledge of good personal hygiene and effective grooming and how to conduct themselves in professional and social setting. This workshop should spark their interest to discover themselves and how best to project a confident and professional image as coverage is wide and may not offer sufficient depth. Students are encouraged to do more research on their own or attend workshops which will give them the depth they desire. \n\n\nFTW204 Personal Branding and Networking Skills\nSMU has built a credible brand among the employers however, its brand attributes must also be reflected in its students. There are certain attributes that have attracted employers to SMU students, such as being articulate, innovative, intellectual curiosity, courage to challenge the status quo, adventuresome, skilful and resourceful. The emphasis should be for students to build a believable and consistent long-lasting personal brand with focus on core values for the workplace and in society, not just being well-groomed. \n\nNetworking skills are critical for students to succeed. To be effective networkers, they need to understand the acceptable decorum and etiquette for establishing business relationships and friendships; and the “how-tos” of maintaining contacts and building long-term relationships at work and play. \n\nThrough this workshop students can be more aware of developing and maintaining a consistent personal brand both in the online and offline world and become more comfortable in having conversations with other peers and professionals in both a social and work-based setting.\n\nFTW205 Interviewing Skills\nInterviews can be at times daunting and can be very stressful especially if the candidate walks into an interview without adequate preparation. Students can use the interview session to their advantage to impress the interviewers and present themselves as good potential hires. The interview session is not only to secure an internship or job but also a two way communication to explore and discover whether there is a good fit between the candidate, the job and the organizational and candidate’s expectations. \n\nThe objective of this workshop is to help students understand the objectives of the interviews, the different types of interviews and equip and practice good interviewing and listening skills in preparation for the internship/job applications.","info_instructors":["MAUREEN ONG","CATHERINE ONG","STEVEN CHONG","CLEMENT ONG","SUZENNE ZHENG"]}},"HUMN009":{"name":"Why We Work: Different Perspectives on the Value of Work and Play","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Social Sciences","info_academic_organization":"School of Social Sciences","info_description":"Most people spend much of their time working.

Conversely, leisure is often seen as the opposite of work. But some studies indicate that people might actually feel more engaged with work than leisure activities (Csikszentmihalyi, 2008). In this course we explore what work means to people, what leisure provides that work does not, and how individuals go about finding a balance between work and non-work in their lives.\n\nBroadly, the objective of this course is to provide students an opportunity to examine and reflect on different perspectives of work and non-work, and to start them on a journey to determine for themselves what work and non-work could be like in their own lives. Specifically, through class discussions and project work, I hope to be able to provide students a broad perspective on what constitutes work and non-work. This sets the stage for them to apply these perspectives to their own lives, and to gain insights for themselves regarding a possible balance between work and non-work, both in the present and the future.","info_instructors":["SERENA WEE"]}},"MGMT003":{"name":"Business, Government and Society","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"This course overviews the economic, legal, social, and ecological responsibilities of business and their implications for managerial decision-making.  The primary theoretical perspective taken is the stakeholder view of the firm which allows for close examination of apparently conflicting goals between different stakeholders' interests.  Related frameworks and applications discussed in this course include corporate social responsibility, globalization, corporate governance, and public policy measures affecting business.
