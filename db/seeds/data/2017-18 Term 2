Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War  I  when  the  US  army  experimented  with  unmanned  aerial  torpedoes.  Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations.  Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various drone functionalities in order to critically assess drone technology and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of unmanned aerial vehicles. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors from three different SMU schools (LKCSB, SIS and SOL)  plus exposure to drone entrepreneurs  and  first-hand,  team-based  experiences  in  piloting  mini drones  within  the SMU campus.","info_instructors":["EUGENE TAN KHENG BOON"," KAN SIEW NING"," THOMAS MENKHOFF"]}},"IS613":{"name":"Cybersecurity Technology and Applications","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - IT in Business","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Information Systems","info_academic_organization":"School of Info Systems MITB","info_description":"This course provides an introduction to cybersecurity.

Students enrolled in the FTW200 will undertake the FTW200 series under the same instructor for five recurring weeks from Week 3 to Week 7 of the school term. Each component is a three-hour session.\n\nFTW201 Job Search Strategies\nJob search strategies will help students who have a general idea of their preferences or bias for certain type of job functions to explore deeper into the career of choice. Students have to perform due diligence and research the industry/job functions they are interested in and what the careers, occupation or their dream job entail and relate it back to their self-assessment and career plan. They need to conduct sufficient research into the companies of choice and how they could “navigate their way” into these companies and job functions. They also need to consider closing skills gaps, if any, and the career path and advancement. \n\nThis workshop introduces to students effective job search strategies, informational interviews, how to get insider’s information on industry and job function requirements.\n\nThe outcome is for students to make a more informed decision on their choice career and options available.\n\n\nFTW202 Resume and Cover Letter Writing \nThis workshop will equip students with the skills to write an effective Cover Letter and resume that will help them secure an internship – this is just the basic workshop as most 2nd years will not have sufficient internship or work experience to help them enhance their employability. Students will be exposed to different formats and the effective uses under various circumstances. They will be taught how to create a CV and the sections which are normally included in a CV and the contents to be featured under each section. Advanced CV writing will be taught as an elective in the 3rd or 4th year for those who want help and guidance to strengthen their CVs and start their job applications. \n\nThis workshop will focus on how to build a good resume as well as how to craft a resume and cover letter befitting to the industry and internship/job they are applying for. \n\n\nFTW203 Social Etiquette and Groom for Success\nThis workshop will deliver to students the knowledge of good personal hygiene and effective grooming and how to conduct themselves in professional and social setting. This workshop should spark their interest to discover themselves and how best to project a confident and professional image as coverage is wide and may not offer sufficient depth. Students are encouraged to do more research on their own or attend workshops which will give them the depth they desire. \n\n\nFTW204 Personal Branding and Networking Skills\nSMU has built a credible brand among the employers however, its brand attributes must also be reflected in its students. There are certain attributes that have attracted employers to SMU students, such as being articulate, innovative, intellectual curiosity, courage to challenge the status quo, adventuresome, skilful and resourceful. The emphasis should be for students to build a believable and consistent long-lasting personal brand with focus on core values for the workplace and in society, not just being well-groomed. \n\nNetworking skills are critical for students to succeed. To be effective networkers, they need to understand the acceptable decorum and etiquette for establishing business relationships and friendships; and the “how-tos” of maintaining contacts and building long-term relationships at work and play. \n\nThrough this workshop students can be more aware of developing and maintaining a consistent personal brand both in the online and offline world and become more comfortable in having conversations with other peers and professionals in both a social and work-based setting.\n\nFTW205 Interviewing Skills\nInterviews can be at times daunting and can be very stressful especially if the candidate walks into an interview without adequate preparation. Students can use the interview session to their advantage to impress the interviewers and present themselves as good potential hires.

Inventors have been observed to be playfully conceiving new product designs and experiences in history as well as in technological innovation. The course investigates this link between play and invention through a broad treatment of the phenomena that examines historical and modern cultural domains (the historical treatment will comprise half or more of the examples). Play was borne out of not only of human desires for leisure and frivolity, but also necessity and cultural purposes, e.g. learning and community bonding respectively. We will broadly construe the forms of play relevant to invention to include not only the creation of playful artifacts, but also the playing around (or playfulness) observed in inventors’ actions, and the passions of inventors.\n\nThe course articulates the relationship between play and invention through both, study, and actual practice using creativity tools and design techniques. We illustrate the link between play and invention through studies of inventors’ life experiences, where their “playing” with concepts, technology and even cultural interpretations helped them to foster new ideas and inventions. Such play involves the creative combining of different concepts, which involves crossing boundaries between knowledge domains, and experimentation. In practicing the ‘play-to-invent’ relationship, we will cover creativity tools for ‘ideating’ concepts from diverse sources of knowledge, and design prototyping methods to flesh out and trial the ideas and concepts. In-class exercises and projects will serve as contexts for teaching and demonstrating these techniques. Note that while these techniques originate from the creative thinking and design fields, our goals are not to exercise sheer creativity for creativity’s sake, or to apply the full cycle of user-centered design thinking. \n\nTo reflect on how play is relevant to successful invention, we will cover a range of social scientific concepts for understanding play in theoretical terms, as well as how play has become relevant to culture. We will also contextualize our learning by covering a range of specific creative domains, including the visual arts, fashion, shopping, narrative, visual arts, food, and digital media. Key principles are highlighted in each domain and its designed forms to help understand how invention occurs within that domain, e.g. the nature of narrative in film, and the role of blends in cuisine. We also show how blends have occurred over historical time, such as when inventors made connections across domains as distantly-related as fashion, early London and Paris shopping galleries, American suburban malls and Disney theme parks; and those of early mechanical toys, computers, and musical instruments. Play facilitates creative blending by cross-fertilizing ideas from different domains, allowing ‘forms’ to transcend boundaries, and ultimately, to radically reshape leisure and culture. \n\nComparisons will be made between historical and modern ‘forms’, and examples will come from across continents, largely from European and American history. A significant part of the course will be a project to design innovative experiences or other ‘forms’ using the creative and design tools, and by incorporating the students’ understanding of the aesthetics and effects of play.","info_instructors":["TED FEICHIN TSCHANG"]}},"COMM102":{"name":"Foundations in Strategic Communication","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"COMM102 is the core course of the communication management major.

For this reason, pitching can be both incredibly terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. \n\nUnderstanding the fundamentals as well as the mechanics of pitching will take you far towards successfully pitching your ideas. And there’s nothing like good, old-fashioned practice with plenty of feedback from peers and experts to help you hone your pitching skills. In this course, we will explore the fundamentals and mechanics of effective pitches and put into practice everything we are learning week by week towards becoming successful pitchers. \n\nWhile many people think of pitching as only useful for those who need to raise money (for example, a start-up pitch), pitching is actually an essential skill for reaching agreement on almost any subject. Agreement can yield many outcomes: management buy-in for developing a product or service, closing a sale, securing a partnership, recruiting an employee, securing an investment, and even securing employment for yourself. \n\nNancy Duarte, a communication specialist, put it this way: “Companies are started, products are launched, climate systems are saved – possibly based on the quality of presentations. Likewise, ideas, endeavours, and even careers can be cut short due to ineffective communication.” In this course, you will be given a good foundation for successful pitching so that no worthy idea or endeavour of yours will fall short simply because it wasn’t effectively conveyed.","info_instructors":["TOM ESTAD"]}},"COMM246":{"name":"Crisis Management and Communication","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"Organizations are, literally, experiencing and battling crises of some form or other every day. This can be internal crises like organizational miscommunication, personality clashes; to external crises, for instance, arising from policy mismanagement to terrorism. Due to the vulnerability of the organization to both internal and external uncertainties, no organization is immune from crises. \n\nWhile organizations recognize the probability of the occurrence of crises, studies have shown that many do not have any preparation or plan to deal with them. Some do not find it necessary to take preventive measures; others simply do not know where to begin, and what to do. Indeed, strategic crisis management is a multifaceted discipline that involves components from issues management, crisis communication and management, conflict recovery and resolution. \n\nThis course aims to equip students with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, how to communicate during crises, and how to recover and learn from crises. The emphasis, thus, is on the preventive, rather than reactive, aspects of crisis management.\n\nScholars agree that crisis management is a dynamic, ongoing process, through a life cycle. Students will be taken through each step of the life cycle of a crisis, with the aim of helping them learn what they need to do at each phase. While many scholars have posited different frameworks, for this course, Wilcox, Cameron and Reber’s (2015) proactive-strategic-reactive-recovery framework is adopted because of its emphasis on the preventive aspects. \n\nIt is a useful course for those who wish to be equipped with knowledge for their work in public relations, consultancy, management, law, strategic communication, and public administration; or for those who wish to embark on research in these areas.","info_instructors":["YEO SU LIN"]}},"COMM332":{"name":"Campaigning and Communication Planning","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"This course helps students fulfil a key employment requirement of the communication industry: the ability to strategically and at high speed develop communication campaigns that support the competitiveness, the reputation, the market access and the licence to operate of their organization.

Economic expansion or recession will change all business forecasts; market structure will affect profitability; fluctuating exchange rates will have an impact on costs, sales, risk perceptions and debt levels; and the state of the national budget or interest-rate decisions can color a company ́s future. In particular, a global recession like the one suffered recently can transform consumption behavior and business strategies. Managerial Economics provides students with a framework to understand the main economic variables and dynamics that affect business activity. Understanding the microeconomy is the first stepping-stone toward achieving a full grasp of the economic world that surrounds us. Most of the world ́s countries rely on free markets to make most of their economic decisions, and those markets automatically answer the key economic questions (What will we produce? How will we produce it? At what price? Who will get it?) through the operation of supply and demand. The course will review the basic concepts of supply, demand, market failures and externalities to provide a broad perspective on how free markets work. It will then move on to elasticity and market structures and their impact on profitability. The objective is to give students a firm understanding of how supply and demand at the micro-level determine the basic parameters of doing business. Yet markets are not perfect. In our times, a period of deregulation and strong faith in markets to solve economic problems has been followed by the deepest economic crisis since the early 20th century, with devastating effects on output, income and employment nearly everywhere. The experience has brought back to the fore the key questions of how economic decisions should be made, and how much governments should intervene when market failures exist, especially in light of pressing problems such as environmental deterioration which the market appears poorly equipped to solve. The second part of the course will focus on the macroeconomy and the policies that governments follow, and how the interaction between free economic forces and policy affect the business cycle and company prospects. It will begin by analyzing the key macroeconomic indicators --GDP, inflation and unemployment and the business cycle--, and evaluate how changes in these variables affect businesses. It will then outline the dynamics of the macroeconomy, the operation of fiscal and monetary policies and how and why policy decisions are made, to give students the tools to anticipate key policy decisions and understand their impact on the macroeconomy. Finally, the course moves from the micro and national levels to the global level, for a look at international trade, exchange rates and the balance of payments. It will detail the forces of trade, the determinants of exchange rates, and the important concepts underlying the balance of payments; and how all of those elements of the international economy affect business. In the process, we will encounter an explanation for the Great Contraction that occurred beginning in 2008, and will be able to understand how the crisis has and will change our economic lives.

The term ‘back office’ is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today’s volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise. \n\nWith complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into ‘intelligent accounting functions’. \n\nIntelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities.\n\nThis accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects.","info_instructors":["PAN SHAN CHI"," GARY"," VENKY SHANKARARAMAN"]}}},"2016-17 Term 3":{"ACCT628":{"name":"Financial Management","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - Prof. Accounting","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Accountancy","info_academic_organization":"School of Accountancy GPO","info_description":"This course aims to provide knowledge of topics involved in day-to-day corporation’s financial management operations as well as advanced analytical techniques which can help create value to companies and organizations.

The term ‘back office’ is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today’s volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise. \n\nWith complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into ‘intelligent accounting functions’. \n\nIntelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities.\n\nThis accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects.","info_instructors":["PAN SHAN CHI"," GARY"," VENKY SHANKARARAMAN"]}},"OBHR612":{"name":"Research in Human Resources","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - PhD Business (OBHR)","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"LKCSB GPO","info_description":"This course covers methods and findings in classic and contemporary research on human resources management.

Goods and services cannot move on their own from supply houses to demand locales, conferring transportation a central role in their distributions. Transportation contributes and increases the values in the chain by performing the \"moving\" functions in the physical distribution of products. In broader terms, transportation is often referred to as the lifelines of a nation and its economy because they are the preconditions for progress and development. Globalization complements trade and further magnifies the importance of efficient and effective transportation.  This course explores the business issues in the design and operations of transportation systems and underlines their strategic importance to firms and the economy. It discusses the core concepts and terminologies of road, air, rail and sea transportation, as well as, the role of international sourcing and logistics in contemporary supply chain management.

Digitization refers to the power of new digital technologies and business models which can lead to the decline and eventual disappearance of existing goods and services. A major challenge related to demographic change is the trend towards a rapidly ageing population. Both trends affect a particular component of diversity, namely age diversity, and thereby generational issues such as perceived differences between older and younger people in terms of values, communication priorities; age discrimination or the initiation of new types of social (‘digital’) behaviours transmitted from the plugged-in ‘Generation Z’ (born 1996 and after) to Baby Boomers (born 1946 to 1964). These three challenges (positioned at the interface of both current and future issues) are not only globally relevant but also have significant local implications for Singapore. \n\nEmbedded in the experiential SMU-X initiative, the Transformative Leadership course provides students with a unique learning opportunity to develop and implement (socially) innovative approaches which leverage digital technologies in order to make a positive impact on both demographic change and the way age diversity matters are managed in business and society in close collaboration with reputable partners in business, nonprofits and government. Learners will be paired up with external SMU-X partners to work on relevant innovative projects with real impact. \n\nAn example of a thematically related learning project from the finance sector is OCBC Bank's so-called “Life-App Day” where student \"technology ambassadors” introduced mature employees (aged 50 and above) to apps aimed at enhancing digital and financial technology learning as well as financial planning skills. A slightly more challenging project goal could be to create new urban (learning) spaces for members of Singapore’s increasingly multi-generational population cum workforce to share, learn, play, exercise, co-create and/or innovate, for example, to study and mitigate the effects of climate change on ‘us’. Another, even more demanding project approach might focus on leveraging ideas generated in the health sciences with regard to extending one’s ‘health span’ (a term which refers to the length of time that a person is healthy—not just alive) with the help of digital technology such as wearables in order to improve the quality of life by reducing the rate of ageing on the basis of preventive behavioural change strategies (as suggested by longevity scientists). Please refer to page 3 (B. Group Project Assignment) for more project examples.\n\nThe successful completion of such transformative SMU-X projects requires learners diving deep(er) into various disciplines such as technology, social sciences, business, political governance, public policy, demography, gerontology etc. It is expected that the chosen practical challenges commissioned by SMU-X partners will ‘stretch’ students, forcing them to step out of their comfort zones and to explore the unknowns in order to make a ‘real’ difference ‘out there’ in both the social and business sectors. \n\nTo come up with innovative solutions, students will be introduced to “design thinking” which has been defined by Tim Brown (President and CEO of the award-winning global design firm IDEO) as a “human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.”\n\nIn terms of effective leader development, the SMU-X course design will support learners in expanding their individual capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Emphasis will be put on proximal indicators of leader development such as self-views around self-concept, including leader self-awareness, leadership self-efficacy and leader identity (besides regular leadership competencies) which will be measured, assessed and discussed on the basis of scientifically proven measures. Through their SMU-X projects, students will appreciate the importance of leadership development so that they can articulate what it takes for teams and their leaders to create strong(er) alignment and high(er) levels of commitment. The latter requires interpersonal trust, care and concern as well as shared mind-sets regarding (transformative) goals and values such as the ‘real’ sharing propelled by collaborative leadership approaches.\n\nPotential SMU-X project partners include the SMU-TCS iCity Lab, the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), Eu Yan Sang International (EYSI), Maybank Singapore, StarHub, onemakergroup and the Council for Third Age (C3A).","info_instructors":["KAN SIEW NING"," THOMAS MENKHOFF"]}},"OPIM707":{"name":"Topics in Manufacturing and Service Operations Management","data":{"info_career":"Graduate - PhD Business (OM)","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"LKCSB GPO","info_description":"The purpose of this course is to introduce the literature on online and omni-channel retailing.

In other words, there is no compulsion for any organization to eventually sponsor the proposed ideas to the organization(s) concerned or may be collaborating with.\n\nThe outcomes of the group project for students are outlined as follows:\n(i) Students will learn about leadership from the leaders they are connecting with. For example, they will learn how and why today’s leaders are engaged in community-based or social initiatives in Singapore and beyond. \n(ii) Students will also learn from the leaders lessons on leadership and/or teamwork based on the leaders’ experiences.\n(iii) By undertaking a hands-on group project, students will also learn practical lessons as well as the complexities of teamwork based on their OWN experience and process of working internally, with their group mates and externally, with organizations outside of school.\n(iv) Each student will also reflect on his/her own learning throughout the project from start to end as outlined below (see ‘Reflection Essay’ for details).\n(v) Students will also fulfill other learning objectives that include cognitive and academic development as outlined below in the section, ‘Learning Objectives’","info_instructors":["JOHN CHEN"," PNG BEE HIN"," RANI TAN","PAUL LIM HENG LEONG","HANOI LOK","TANG DICK SHUN","KAN SIEW NING","ROGER LOW","KENNETH TAI"]}},"OBHR228":{"name":"The Psychology of Managerial Decision Making","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"The quality of decision making determines whether a company rides the waves of success or falters.

A significant part of the course will focus on Asia, but we will make comparisons with other developed and developing regions, especially given that much of the sustainability material is based on experiences and concepts from non-Asian regions. Environmental sustainability, and more generally, sustainability, has become increasingly important to developed and developing nations alike. The typical issues include resource scarcity and polluted environments, but the more recent issue of climate change has become a major issue. In contrast, sustainability issues in poorer regions usually involve human development concerns, such as reducing poverty and improving health and fulfilling other basic needs. Nearly half of the course will be on managing such issues of human development issues (and indirectly, their intertwined nature with environmental problems). Where possible, we will show the links between environmental sustainability and poverty. While solutions to these problems may require the involvement of the private sector (firms), the public sector (government) and the community, firms are increasingly called on to reduce their negative impacts on the environment and humans alike. The course will focus in particular on how business can address sustainability issues. Sustainability issues often consist of complex interactions between human activity and the environment. The course will apply several academic perspectives to characterizing these problems and their possible solutions. The course first examines how particular patterns of economic and social development are manifested in past practices and developmental paths, such as unsustainable patterns of urbanization and industrialization. The private sector is an integral part of many problems and solutions, and as such, will be the main focus of the course. An important part of addressing sustainability is the use of various frameworks to help incorporate a sustainability perspective into firms’ strategies and operations. These often employ a systems perspective. To help characterize firm’ sustainability and determine appropriate courses of action, the course will cover also specific managerial tools and frameworks that help to characterize sustainability challenges and incorporate them into corporate plans include the Triple Bottom Line, Life-Cycle Assessment, and the Base of the Pyramid approach and its business models. Where necessary, material on and links to concepts of strategy, business models, stakeholder engagement, public policy (in terms of governance), and innovation will be made.While many of the sustainability concepts have a Western origin, because of our location in Asia, and the increasing importance of sustainability to the local and regional context, especial attention has been paid to relating each section of the course to Asia, even as the original material (concepts and experiences) is covered from the (non-Asian) country or region of origin. This will be done through a series of cases and examples, especially for the part of the course covering industrialization- and poverty-related sustainability issues. Examples of Asia-specific material introduced in past classes and continued this year include material on the early phases of Japan’s industrialization and pollution and its eventual social-regulatory reforms; China’s ongoing sustainability problems as it continues to industrialize; China’s renewable energy policy and planning; agro-based eco-industrial parks (industrial ecosystems) in Turkey; the ongoing poverty issues in the region, and solutions (technological and otherwise) as practiced in India and Bangladesh); and finally, issues that Singapore faces. Similarly, the poor in the East and in other developing regions face many of the same issues as seen in other developing and developed regions, and so cross-comparisons between different regions can yield many lessons.","info_instructors":["TED FEICHIN TSCHANG","Staff"]}},"MGMT304":{"name":"Entrepreneurial Leadership in Ethnic Chinese Business","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_academic_organization":"Lee Kong Chian Sch of Business","info_description":"Since the mid-1980s intra-regional trade and investment links in East and Southeast Asia have expanded rapidly with the shift of production by firms from Japan and newly industrializing countries to lower-cost, neighboring countries.

Inventors have been observed to be playfully conceiving new product designs and experiences in history as well as in technological innovation. The course investigates this link between play and invention through a broad treatment of the phenomena that examines historical and modern cultural domains (the historical treatment will comprise half or more of the examples). Play was borne out of not only of human desires for leisure and frivolity, but also necessity and cultural purposes, e.g. learning and community bonding respectively. We will broadly construe the forms of play relevant to invention to include not only the creation of playful artifacts, but also the playing around (or playfulness) observed in inventors’ actions, and the passions of inventors.\n\nThe course articulates the relationship between play and invention through both, study, and actual practice using creativity tools and design techniques. We illustrate the link between play and invention through studies of inventors’ life experiences, where their “playing” with concepts, technology and even cultural interpretations helped them to foster new ideas and inventions. Such play involves the creative combining of different concepts, which involves crossing boundaries between knowledge domains, and experimentation. In practicing the ‘play-to-invent’ relationship, we will cover creativity tools for ‘ideating’ concepts from diverse sources of knowledge, and design prototyping methods to flesh out and trial the ideas and concepts. In-class exercises and projects will serve as contexts for teaching and demonstrating these techniques. Note that while these techniques originate from the creative thinking and design fields, our goals are not to exercise sheer creativity for creativity’s sake, or to apply the full cycle of user-centered design thinking. \n\nTo reflect on how play is relevant to successful invention, we will cover a range of social scientific concepts for understanding play in theoretical terms, as well as how play has become relevant to culture. We will also contextualize our learning by covering a range of specific creative domains, including the visual arts, fashion, shopping, narrative, visual arts, food, and digital media. Key principles are highlighted in each domain and its designed forms to help understand how invention occurs within that domain, e.g. the nature of narrative in film, and the role of blends in cuisine. We also show how blends have occurred over historical time, such as when inventors made connections across domains as distantly-related as fashion, early London and Paris shopping galleries, American suburban malls and Disney theme parks; and those of early mechanical toys, computers, and musical instruments. Play facilitates creative blending by cross-fertilizing ideas from different domains, allowing ‘forms’ to transcend boundaries, and ultimately, to radically reshape leisure and culture. \n\nComparisons will be made between historical and modern ‘forms’, and examples will come from across continents, largely from European and American history. A significant part of the course will be a project to design innovative experiences or other ‘forms’ using the creative and design tools, and by incorporating the students’ understanding of the aesthetics and effects of play.","info_instructors":["TED FEICHIN TSCHANG"]}},"JPAN201":{"name":"Japanese","data":{"info_career":"Undergraduate","info_units":1.0,"info_grading_basis":"Graded","info_course_components":"Seminar Required","info_campus":"Main Campus","info_academic_group":"School of Social Sciences","info_academic_organization":"School of Social Sciences","info_description":"Japanese is designed for students with no previous background in Japanese.

These factors affect all urban phenomena. Secondly, the course analyzes the internal spatial structure of a city by developing a theory of commuting, housing demand and housing production. It then analyzes transportation and land/housing issues in more detail. On transportation, we focus on the economics of traffic congestions, the rationale for congestion pricing (ERP), and the so-called fundamental law of highway congestion. The discussion on land and housing, will address various housing phenomena such as tenure choice and location. The courses will discuss the optimality of local public good provision, and connect local public finance and housing markets with land taxation. Finally, the course addresses the economics of urban planning to comprehend various urban forms that are found in different cities in the world.

This prompts the question: Why are some countries rich and others poor? From around 1870 until the Second World War, Japan’s income per capita remained around 25 percent of U.S. income per capita. After the substantial reforms put in place at the end of the war, Japanese relative income rose sharply so that today Japanese standard of living is roughly two-thirds that of the U.S. level. The rapid catch-up was also achieved in the post-war period by several other Asian economies including Singapore. What is it that makes it possible for countries to produce growth miracles? For much of world history, people lived at subsistence levels well described by Thomas Malthus. Around the nineteenth century, however, there was an escape from Malthusian stagnation beginning in Europe. What is the engine of economic growth? Gasoline contributes to air pollution as it powers our cars. The release of carbon dioxide as oil and gasoline are burned contributes to global warming.

It then proceeds to discuss the economics underlying social transfer schemes and a variety of other public sector programs that falls outside the ambit of the so-called \"minimum\" role. Here, governmental expenditure programs such as programs on health care, social security and education come into focus. Finally, the module discusses the financing of government programs bringing into focus the taxation system. The efficiency and distributional effects of different taxes and their implication on the choice of financing method and on project evaluation are some of the issues that will be discussed here. An introduction to optimal taxation theory is also included here.
